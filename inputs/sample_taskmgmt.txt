Task Management Application Requirements

We need to build a collaborative task management application for small to medium-sized teams.

Key Features:

1. User Management
   - Team member registration and login
   - User profiles with role assignments (Admin, Manager, Member)
   - Team workspace creation and management

2. Task Management
   - Create, edit, and delete tasks
   - Assign tasks to team members
   - Set priorities, due dates, and tags
   - Add comments and attachments to tasks
   - Track task status (To Do, In Progress, Done)

3. Collaboration
   - Real-time updates when tasks change
   - Comment threads on tasks
   - @mention notifications for team members
   - Activity feed showing team actions

4. File Management
   - Upload and attach files to tasks
   - Support for various file types (documents, images, PDFs)
   - File preview functionality

5. Notifications
   - Email notifications for task assignments
   - In-app notifications for mentions and updates
   - Daily digest emails of team activity

6. Reporting
   - Dashboard with task statistics
   - Team productivity metrics
   - Export task lists and reports

The application should be accessible via web browser and will store user data, task information, file attachments, and activity logs. We expect integration with third-party services like Slack and email providers.
