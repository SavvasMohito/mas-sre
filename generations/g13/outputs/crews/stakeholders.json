Security mechanisms enforcing boundaries include user authentication (email/password and integration with external identity providers), role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure users can only access data and functionalities pertinent to their roles, and network segmentation to mitigate risks of unauthorized access. Company Employees can access files and folders associated with their company, while Company Administrators have broader management capabilities. External Auditors can access specific audit logs and reports but cannot modify any data. The principle of least privilege is implemented by granting users the minimum access necessary to perform their responsibilities; for instance, Company Employees only have permissions to read/write their files, and Company Administrators can delegate permissions but cannot escalate their own privileges without proper logging and oversight. This minimizes the risk of data exposure and privilege escalation through careful management of user roles and permissions.",
