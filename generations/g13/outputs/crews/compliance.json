  "raw": "### 8.1.

Compliance requirements have a direct impact on security controls, data handling procedures, and operational processes that ensure the protection of sensitive information while meeting legal obligations.\n\n| Regulation | Applicability Reason |\n|------------|----------------------|\n| GDPR       | GDPR applies because the system processes personal data of EU residents, including user registration and file management activities. |\n| CCPA       | CCPA applies due to the handling of personal data of California residents, necessitating transparency and user rights regarding their information. |\n| HIPAA      | HIPAA applies if any health-related information is processed within the file management application, especially if used by healthcare organizations. |\n| PCI-DSS    | PCI-DSS applies if payment card data is processed or stored, which requires strict controls around encryption and access. |\n| SOX        | SOX applies due to the financial data management involved, particularly for companies subject to financial audits. |\n| COPPA      | COPPA applies if any personal data of children under 13 years is collected, mandating parental consent for data processing. |\n| Data Residency Laws | Applicable as the application may need to comply with location-specific data storage and processing regulations based on user geography. |\n\n### 8.2. Compliance Controls by Regulation\n\n#### GDPR\n- Implement data minimization and purpose limitation principles.\n- Ensure user consent is obtained for data processing activities.\n- Provide users with access to their data and the ability to request corrections or deletions.\n- Enforce encryption of personal data at rest and in transit.\n\n#### CCPA\n- Provide clear disclosures about the collection and use of personal data.\n- Allow users the right to opt-out of data selling.\n- Implement mechanisms for users to request access to their data or deletion of their data.\n\n#### HIPAA\n- Ensure all health information is encrypted and access is limited to authorized personnel.\n- Implement audit controls to monitor access to health data.\n- Train employees on HIPAA compliance and privacy practices.\n\n#### PCI-DSS\n- Encrypt payment card data and implement strong access control measures.\n- Regularly monitor and test networks to ensure compliance.\n- Maintain an information security policy for data protection.\n\n#### SOX\n- Implement internal controls for financial reporting and data integrity.\n- Ensure audit trails are maintained for all financial data transactions.\n\n#### COPPA\n- Obtain verifiable parental consent before collecting personal data from children under 13.\n- Provide parents with access to their children\u2019s data and the ability to delete it.\n\n### 8.3. Data Subject Rights\n\n| Right | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| Right to Access | Users can request access to their personal data processed by the application. |\n| Right to Rectification | Users can request corrections to inaccurate personal data. |\n| Right to Erasure | Users have the right to request deletion of their personal data under certain conditions. |\n| Right to Data Portability | Users can request their data in a structured, commonly used format. |\n| Right to Opt-Out | Users can opt-out of the sale of their personal information under CCPA. |\n\n### 8.4. Privacy Requirements\n**Consent:** Users must give explicit consent for their personal data to be processed, particularly for sensitive data categories.  \n**Transparency:** Clear privacy notices must be provided detailing data collection, usage, and sharing practices.  \n**Parental Consent:** For users under 13, verifiable parental consent must be obtained prior to data collection.\n\n### 8.5. Audit and Monitoring Requirements\n**Logging:** Immutable audit logs must record user actions, timestamps, and affected files to ensure accountability.  \n**Monitoring:** Continuous monitoring of access and changes to sensitive data is required to detect and respond to unauthorized access.\n\n### 8.6. Data Handling Rules\n**Retention:** Personal data should be retained only as long as necessary for its intended purpose and as required by law.  \n**Deletion:** Procedures must be in place for the secure deletion of personal data upon request or when no longer needed.\n\n### 8.7. Compliance Risk Assessment  \nThe compliance risk assessment identifies potential legal and operational risks associated with non-compliance with applicable regulations. \n\n**Key Compliance Risks:**  \n\n- Non-compliance with GDPR due to inadequate data handling procedures could result in significant fines.\n- Inadequate user consent mechanisms might lead to violations of CCPA and COPPA.\n- Failure to implement necessary security controls for health data could expose the organization to HIPAA violations and penalties.",
