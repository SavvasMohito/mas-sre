AI/ML Security Controls  \n\n#### Electronic Signature Verification  \n- **Prompt Injection Prevention**: Implement strict validation on input parameters for signature verification processes to ensure no malicious prompts can alter expected behaviors.  \n- **Input Validation for AI Inputs**: Validate all inputs against predefined schemas and rules to prevent injection and ensure that only safe data is processed.  \n- **Output Filtering and Sanitization**: Sanitize outputs from the electronic signature verification process to prevent leakage of sensitive information.  \n- **Data Leakage Prevention**: Ensure that training data does not contain PII or sensitive information, and implement mechanisms to anonymize data used for training models.  \n- **Model Access Controls**: Limit access to the electronic signature verification model to only authorized personnel and applications to mitigate unauthorized access risks.  \n- **Rate Limiting and Abuse Prevention**: Implement rate limiting on requests to the signature verification system to prevent abuse and denial of service attacks.  \n- **Monitoring for Adversarial Inputs**: Continuously monitor inputs to the model for signs of adversarial manipulation and trigger alerts on suspicious patterns.  \n- **Model Versioning and Rollback Capabilities**: Maintain version control of the electronic signature verification model to allow for rollback in case of detected vulnerabilities or performance issues.  \n- **Supply Chain Security for Models**: Assess the security of third-party ML models and libraries involved in electronic signature verification to prevent supply chain attacks.  \n- **Bias and Fairness Considerations**: Regularly audit the model for biases in signature validation, ensuring fair treatment across all user demographics.\n\n### 7.4. Integration with Existing Security Controls  \nAI controls for the electronic signature verification component integrate seamlessly with existing security practices such as role-based access control (RBAC) and encryption. By enforcing strict access controls, the application ensures that only authorized users can interact with the AI components. Additionally, the implementation of data encryption both at rest and in transit complements the AI security measures to maintain data confidentiality and integrity.\n\n### 7.5. AI/ML Monitoring Requirements  \n\n| Monitoring Area                     | Description                                               |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Signature Verification Logs          | Continuously log all activities related to signature verifications for auditing and compliance. |\n| Anomaly Detection                    | Implement systems to detect unusual patterns in signature requests that may indicate a security threat. |\n| Model Performance Monitoring         | Regularly assess the accuracy and reliability of the electronic signature verification model to ensure it operates as intended. |",
