Balance automated scanning with manual evaluations to prioritize high-risk areas based on business impact, adhering to shift-left security principles by incorporating security testing earlier and continuously. This approach ensures that security is an integral part of development and operations, significantly reducing the risk of vulnerabilities in production.\n\n### 11.2.

Compliance controls will be mapped against each applicable regulation, and audit preparation will involve ensuring documentation and evidence collection for external audits. Recommendations will include engaging third-party auditors for comprehensive evaluations to validate adherence to regulations and enhance the overall security posture.\n\n### 11.4. Continuous Monitoring  \nImplement Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) for real-time monitoring, supported by Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) to identify and mitigate threats. All logs will be aggregated and analyzed for anomalies, with integration into incident response processes to ensure prompt action against security events. Continuous monitoring will also include alerts for unusual activities and compliance violations, facilitating swift remediation and ongoing risk assessment.\n\n### 11.5.
