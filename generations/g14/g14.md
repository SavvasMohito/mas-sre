Timesheet Website Requirements

We need to build a web application for employees to track work hours, submit timesheets for approval, and manage holiday requests.

Key Features:

1. User Roles
   - Employee: Create, view, and submit weekly timesheets; enter hours per day with project/task codes; request and record holiday; view holiday balance and historical timesheets
   - Manager: View and approve or reject employee timesheets; view team members' timesheet history and holiday usage; assign delegates for approval
   - Delegate: Perform manager approval tasks for specific periods
   - Administrator: Configure system-wide settings (workweek rules, public holidays, user management); configure working patterns; view audit logs; amend timesheets after submission

2. Timesheet Entry
   - Enter hours worked per day, per week, with support for multiple tasks/projects
   - Save draft before submission
   - Prevent submission until all required fields are completed
   - Track total weekly hours and enforce minimum/maximum limits if configured

3. Timesheet Submission and Approval
   - Submit weekly timesheets for approval
   - Record submission timestamp
   - Timesheets become read-only after submission unless rejected
   - Managers approve or reject with comments
   - Approval/rejection actions logged with time and identity

4. Holiday & Leave Management
   - Request holiday days within timesheet or dedicated interface
   - Holidays automatically populate in timesheet week as non-working hours
   - Track remaining leave balance per user
   - Managers approve or reject holiday requests
   - Preload public holidays and auto-apply to relevant days

5. Manager Delegation
   - Assign delegates authorized to approve timesheets
   - Delegation includes start/end dates and scope of permissions
   - Delegates receive same notifications for approval tasks
   - Managers can revoke delegation at any time

6. Notifications
   - Email notifications for timesheet submission reminders
   - Notifications for timesheet approval needed
   - Approval or rejection confirmations
   - Delegation change notifications

7. Reporting
   - Weekly, monthly, and custom time reports for employees and managers
   - Audit logs capturing timesheet creation/updates, submissions, approvals/rejections, and delegation changes

8. System Requirements
   - Responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile
   - Accessible UI compliant with WCAG guidelines
   - Integration with Azure SSO for authentication

The application will store user data, timesheet entries, holiday requests, approval workflows, and audit logs. Data access is restricted based on team hierarchy.
