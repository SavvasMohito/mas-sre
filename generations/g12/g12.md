CI Build Automation Tool - Web Application Requirements

We need to build a web application to automate FPGA build flows (from web browser to HPC servers), which includes selecting the file set, giving it to EDA tools for linting, synthesis, place & route, and timing analysis, and submitting jobs to a cluster.

The application should be a modern web application accessible through a browser, with a responsive web interface for users to manage builds, monitor progress, and access results. The web application communicates with backend services that handle FPGA card interactions and HPC server job submissions. A database is maintained for cataloging and inventory.

The application should be integrated with GitHub for automated builds from branches.

Key features:

1. User Management & Authentication
    1. Users should authenticate via Active Directory (AD) integration (SSO)
    2. Users should access the application through a web browser
    3. Role-based access control (RBAC) for different user permissions
    4. User profile management and preferences
    5. Session management and secure logout

2. Web Interface & User Experience
    1. Responsive web dashboard for monitoring builds and tasks
    2. Real-time status updates using WebSockets or Server-Sent Events
    3. Interactive file browser and upload interface
    4. Drag-and-drop file upload functionality
    5. Web-based task creation and management forms
    6. Live log viewer with auto-refresh for EDA tool outputs
    7. Interactive charts and visualizations for build statistics
    8. Mobile-responsive design for access on tablets and phones

3. Task Management
    1. Create, edit, and delete build tasks through web interface
    2. Submit tasks to HPC servers via web API
    3. Track task status (To Do, In Progress, Done, Failed) with visual indicators
    4. Task queue management and prioritization
    5. Task history and audit trail
    6. Bulk task operations (create multiple tasks, cancel multiple tasks)

4. File Management
    1. Web-based file upload interface for attaching files to HPC infrastructure
    2. File browser to view and manage uploaded files
    3. Download build artifacts and results through web interface
    4. File versioning and history
    5. Support for large file uploads with progress indicators
    6. File preview capabilities for common file types

5. HPC & FPGA Integration (Backend Services)
    1. REST API endpoints for submitting jobs to HPC infrastructure via SLURM
    2. Web API for programming FPGAs with bitfiles
    3. Background job processing service for HPC communication
    4. Integration with UART ports for FPGA communication (handled by backend)
    5. Real-time status updates pushed to web clients

6. GitHub Integration
    1. OAuth-based GitHub authentication
    2. Web interface for selecting GitHub repositories and branches
    3. Automated build triggers from GitHub webhooks
    4. Display GitHub commit information and branch details in web UI
    5. Link builds to specific commits and pull requests

7. Notifications
    1. In-app notifications displayed in web interface
    2. Email notifications when builds are completed
    3. Browser push notifications (optional)
    4. Notification preferences and settings in user profile
    5. Notification history and read/unread status

8. Reporting & Analytics
    1. Web-based dashboard with build statistics and metrics
    2. Live log streaming from EDA tools in web interface
    3. Export build logs as downloadable files (PDF, CSV, TXT)
    4. Generate and export reports for builds per user per time period
    5. Interactive charts and graphs for build trends
    6. Build success/failure rate visualizations
    7. Performance metrics and timing analysis reports

9.  Deployment & Maintenance
    1. Web application deployment via containerization (Docker)
    2. Automated deployment and updates with Ansible
    3. Health check endpoints for monitoring
    4. Web-based admin panel for system configuration
    5. Database backup and restore through web interface
