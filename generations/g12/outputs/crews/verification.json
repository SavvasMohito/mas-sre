  "raw": "### 11.1. Testing Approach\nIntegrate security testing throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC) with an emphasis on continuous security practices. Balance automated scanning with manual evaluations to prioritize high-risk areas based on business impact, adhering to shift-left security principles by incorporating security testing earlier and continuously. This approach ensures that vulnerabilities are identified and remediated in a timely manner, aligning with compliance requirements and organizational security policies.\n\n### 11.2. Testing Methods\n| Method | Frequency | Tools |\n|--------|-----------|-------|\n| STATIC APPLICATION SECURITY TESTING (SAST) | Every commit/build | SonarQube, Semgrep, Checkmarx, CodeQL |\n| DYNAMIC APPLICATION SECURITY TESTING (DAST) | Nightly/weekly | OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, Acunetix |\n| DEPENDENCY SCANNING | Every build | Snyk, Dependabot, OWASP Dependency-Check |\n| SECRETS SCANNING | Every commit | TruffleHog, GitLeaks, GitHub Secret Scanning |\n| CONTAINER/INFRASTRUCTURE SCANNING | Every deployment | Trivy, Clair, Prowler, ScoutSuite |\n| PENETRATION TESTING | Quarterly or before major releases | Custom scripts, Metasploit, Burp Suite Pro |\n| SECURITY CODE REVIEW | For critical features | GitHub/GitLab code review, security checklists |\n| COMPLIANCE SCANNING | Continuous | AWS Config, Azure Policy, Cloud Custodian |\n\n### 11.3. Compliance Verification\nMulti-standard compliance (OWASP ASVS, NIST SP 800-53, ISO 27001) will be verified through automated tools and manual checks against regulatory requirements such as GDPR, CCPA, and PCI-DSS. Audit preparation will involve ensuring documentation and evidence collection for external audits, including user consent records and data handling policies. Recommendations will include engaging third-party auditors for comprehensive evaluations to validate compliance with industry standards and legal obligations.\n\n### 11.4. Continuous Monitoring\nImplement Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) for real-time monitoring, supported by Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) to identify and mitigate threats. All logs will be aggregated and analyzed for anomalies, with integration into incident response processes to ensure prompt action against security events. Continuous monitoring will also include regular assessments of security controls and compliance adherence, ensuring that the security posture remains robust and effective.\n\n### 11.5. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)\n- Mean time to detect (MTTD) security issues  \n- Mean time to remediate (MTTR) vulnerabilities  \n- Percentage of critical vulnerabilities patched within SLA  \n- Security test coverage percentage  \n- False positive rate in automated scanning  \n- Compliance audit pass rate  \n\n### 11.6. Mapping Testing Methods to Security Controls\n- SAST: Verifies input validation, injection flaws, and hardcoded secrets.\n- DAST: Validates authentication, authorization, XSS, CSRF, and SQL injection controls.\n- Dependency Scanning: Ensures supply chain security via identification of vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.\n- Secrets Scanning: Protects against exposure of credentials and API keys.\n- Container/Infrastructure Scanning: Enforces configuration management for container security.\n- Penetration Testing: Assesses all high-risk controls and provides a holistic view of the application's security.\n- Security Code Review: Ensures the integrity of authentication, authorization, and cryptographic implementations.\n- Compliance Scanning: Validates adherence to regulatory compliance controls across the application.\n\nThis comprehensive security verification and testing strategy ensures a proactive and thorough approach to maintaining security and compliance within the CI Build Automation Tool environment.",
