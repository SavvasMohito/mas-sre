  "raw": "### 8.1. Applicable Regulations  \nThe regulations applicable to the CI Build Automation Tool were identified based on the types of data processed (e.g., personal data, health data), geographic scope (e.g., European Union, California), industry sector (e.g., technology, healthcare), and business operations (e.g., cloud computing, job submission to HPC servers). Compliance requirements directly impact security controls, data handling procedures, and operational processes, ensuring that the application adheres to legal obligations and protects user privacy. Below is a summary of the regulations that apply to the application:\n\n| Regulation | Applicability Reason |\n|------------|----------------------|\n| GDPR       | Applies because the system processes personal data of EU residents. |\n| CCPA       | Applies due to the collection of personal data from California residents. |\n| HIPAA      | Relevant if any health information is processed or transmitted. |\n| PCI-DSS    | Applicable if payment card data is handled for any transactions. |\n| SOX        | Relevant due to the need for financial data management and reporting. |\n| GLBA       | Applies as the application may handle sensitive financial information. |\n| COPPA      | Relevant if the application collects data from children under 13. |\n| Data Residency Laws | Applies based on geographic data storage and processing requirements. |\n\n### 8.2. Compliance Controls by Regulation\n\n#### GDPR\n- Implement data encryption both in transit and at rest.\n- Establish a data protection officer role.\n- Ensure user consent is obtained before processing personal data.\n- Implement data minimization practices.\n\n#### CCPA\n- Provide clear notices about data collection practices.\n- Allow users to opt-out of the sale of their personal data.\n- Implement a process for data access requests.\n\n#### HIPAA\n- Ensure data encryption and access controls are in place for health data.\n- Conduct regular risk assessments of health information handling.\n- Provide training for employees on HIPAA compliance.\n\n#### PCI-DSS\n- Implement network security controls to protect cardholder data.\n- Conduct regular vulnerability scans and penetration tests.\n- Maintain a secure application development lifecycle.\n\n#### SOX\n- Ensure proper documentation and reporting of financial data.\n- Implement controls for data integrity and access management.\n\n#### GLBA\n- Maintain privacy notices regarding the sharing of nonpublic personal information.\n- Implement safeguards to protect customer information.\n\n#### COPPA\n- Obtain verifiable parental consent before collecting information from children.\n- Provide clear privacy notices aimed at parents.\n\n### 8.3. Data Subject Rights\n\n| Right | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| Right to Access | Users can request access to their personal data and obtain a copy. |\n| Right to Rectification | Users can request corrections to inaccurate or incomplete data. |\n| Right to Erasure | Users can request deletion of their personal data under certain conditions. |\n| Right to Restrict Processing | Users can request the limitation of processing their data. |\n| Right to Data Portability | Users can request their data in a structured, commonly used format. |\n| Right to Object | Users can object to the processing of their data for certain purposes. |\n\n### 8.4. Privacy Requirements  \n**Consent:** Users must provide explicit consent before their personal data is processed.  \n**Privacy Notice:** A clear and concise privacy notice must be provided to users detailing data collection, usage, and sharing practices.  \n**Data Security:** Implement technical and organizational measures to protect personal data from unauthorized access or breaches.\n\n### 8.5. Audit and Monitoring Requirements  \n**Logging:** Maintain detailed logs of user activity, data access, and system changes for audit purposes.  \n**Monitoring:** Conduct regular monitoring of systems for compliance with security controls and data protection measures.  \n**Incident Response:** Develop an incident response plan to address potential data breaches or compliance failures.\n\n### 8.6. Data Handling Rules  \n**Retention:** Personal data should only be retained as long as necessary for its intended purpose and in compliance with regulatory requirements.  \n**Deletion:** Establish procedures for the secure deletion of personal data when it is no longer needed.  \n**Access Control:** Implement strict access control measures to limit data access to authorized personnel only.\n\n### 8.7. Compliance Risk Assessment  \nCompliance risks must be assessed regularly to identify potential vulnerabilities in the system and to ensure adherence to regulations. This includes evaluating the effectiveness of implemented controls and making necessary adjustments.\n\n**Key Compliance Risks:**\n\n- Risk of non-compliance with GDPR and potential fines due to inadequate data protection measures.\n  \n- Risk of unauthorized access to sensitive health information leading to HIPAA violations.\n  \n- Risk of data breaches involving payment information resulting in PCI-DSS non-compliance.",
