Prioritization Framework\nPrioritization is essential for effective security implementation as it helps in systematically addressing the most critical vulnerabilities and compliance requirements first, ensuring that limited resources are utilized efficiently to protect the organization's core assets. The criteria used to prioritize security control implementation ensure that security investments are aligned with risk levels, compliance requirements, technical feasibility, resource availability, and business needs.\n\n**Prioritization Criteria:**\n\n- **Risk Level**: Controls addressing critical and high-risk threats (identified through threat modeling) are prioritized first\n\n- **Compliance Deadlines**: Regulatory requirements and compliance deadlines influence immediate priority\n\n- **Technical Complexity**: Controls requiring foundational infrastructure are implemented early to enable subsequent controls\n\n- **Dependencies**: Controls that other security measures depend upon are prioritized accordingly\n\n- **Resource Availability**: Implementation considers the availability of skilled personnel, tools, and budget\n\n- **Business Impact**: Controls protecting business-critical functions and data receive higher priority\n\nThese criteria work together to create a logical implementation sequence that balances security needs with practical constraints, ensuring that critical risks are mitigated promptly while setting the foundation for long-term security improvements.\n\n### 10.2. Phased Implementation Plan\n\n#### Phase: IMMEDIATE\n**Timeline:** 0-1 months\n\n**Rationale:** This phase focuses on addressing critical vulnerabilities, essential authentication and authorization controls, and compliance blockers to immediately mitigate the most significant risks and achieve baseline security posture.\n\n**Controls to Implement:**\n\n- Implement Active Directory (AD) SSO with MFA for all users\n- Deploy HTTPS/TLS across all web and API endpoints\n- Enforce secure session management with token rotation and session timeout\n- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit\n\n**Dependencies:**\n\n- Require deployment of AD infrastructure and SSO configuration\n- Completion of TLS certificate procurement and installation\n\n#### Phase: SHORT-TERM\n**Timeline:** 1-3 months\n\n**Rationale:** These controls build upon immediate security measures, focusing on improving access control adjustments and ensuring that logging and API security mitigate identified threats effectively.\n\n**Controls to Implement:**\n\n- Enhance user authentication through comprehensive multi-factor authentication\n- Deploy role-based access controls across the admin dashboard\n- Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring for all administrative actions\n- Strengthen API security with input validation and HTTPS protocols\n- Begin encryption for all sensitive data at rest\n\n**Dependencies:**\n\n- Completion of TLS Implementation\n- Completion of multi-factor authentication\n\n#### Phase: MEDIUM-TERM\n**Timeline:** 3-6 months\n\n**Rationale:** This phase focuses on enhancing threat detection, automating security testing, and performing third-party security audits to identify and mitigate advanced threats.\n\n**Controls to Implement:**\n\n- Deploy advanced threat detection and response tools\n- Implement automated security testing in CI/CD pipelines\n- Conduct third-party security audits and penetration testing\n- Enhance data protection with advanced encryption techniques\n\n**Dependencies:**\n\n- Completion of role-based access control deployment\n- Availability of third-party security auditing firms\n\n#### Phase: LONG-TERM\n**Timeline:** 6-12 months\n\n**Rationale:** Strategic initiatives and continuous improvements are targeted to mature the security posture, such as advanced AI/ML security controls and comprehensive penetration testing.\n\n**Controls to Implement:**\n\n- Develop and implement AI/ML-based security analytics\n- Conduct comprehensive penetration testing for all systems\n- Launch security awareness and training programs for staff\n- Expand security maturity assessments and remediation plans\n\n**Dependencies:**\n\n- Establishment of a security analytics team\n- Completion of initial security maturity assessment\n\n#### Phase: ONGOING\n**Timeline:** Continuous\n\n**Rationale:** Ongoing activities ensure the continuous monitoring, patch management, compliance audits, and incident response readiness to maintain and enhance the security posture over time.\n\n**Controls to Implement:**\n\n- Maintain continuous security monitoring and alerting\n- Implement regular patch management cycles for all systems\n- Conduct periodic compliance audits and reviews\n- Enhance incident response readiness with drills and updates\n\n**Dependencies:**\n\n- Establishment of a dedicated security operations center (SOC)\n- Ongoing collaboration with compliance and audit teams\n\n### 10.3.
