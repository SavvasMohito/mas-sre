Trust Model\n\nTrust boundaries are established at the user interface, backend server, and database levels. Security mechanisms enforcing boundaries include user authentication via Active Directory (AD) for SSO, role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure users can only access data and functionalities pertinent to their roles, and network segmentation to mitigate risks of unauthorized access. End users can only access their builds and logs relevant to their roles; Project Managers have additional access to project timelines and task management features; Administrators have comprehensive management functions. The principle of least privilege is implemented by granting users the minimum access necessary to perform their responsibilities, thereby reducing the risk of data exposure and privilege escalation. Automated services (like GitHub integration and HPC job scheduling) are confined to specific functionalities, thus minimizing their potential attack surface. The system's design ensures that no user or service can escalate privileges beyond their assigned roles, maintaining strict access control and monitoring all interactions through audit logs.",
