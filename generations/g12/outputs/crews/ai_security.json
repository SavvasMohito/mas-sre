AI/ML Components Detected\nThis section identifies all AI/ML components within the system that require specialized security controls.\n\n1. **Automated Build Triggering**: Integrates with GitHub to automatically initiate builds based on commits and pull requests, which may involve processing input data and triggering related AI/ML workflows.\n2. **Real-time Status Updates**: Utilizes WebSockets or Server-Sent Events to push build status updates to the web interface, potentially leveraging ML models for intelligent notifications.\n3. **Interactive Reporting & Analytics**: Generates build statistics and performance metrics, which may involve machine learning algorithms to analyze trends and predict future build outcomes.\n\n### 7.2. AI/ML Threat Model\n\n| Component                     | Identified Threats                              |\n|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| Automated Build Triggering     | - Prompt injection                               |\n|                               | - Data leakage from training data               |\n|                               | - Model inversion attacks                        |\n| Real-time Status Updates       | - Adversarial inputs                            |\n|                               | - Data leakage through status updates           |\n| Interactive Reporting & Analytics | - Model poisoning                             |\n|                               | - Bias and fairness issues                      |\n\n### 7.3. AI/ML Security Controls \n\n#### Automated Build Triggering\n- **Prompt Injection Prevention**: Implement strict input validation and sanitization for build triggers to prevent malicious code from being executed during automated builds.\n- **Data Leakage Prevention**: Ensure that sensitive data (e.g., PII) is not included in training data or prompts used in automated processes.\n- **Model Access Controls**: Restrict access to the model interfaces through RBAC, ensuring only authorized personnel can trigger builds and interact with AI components.\n\n#### Real-time Status Updates\n- **Output Filtering and Sanitization**: Apply sanitization measures on real-time updates to prevent injection attacks or the exposure of sensitive information through status messages.\n- **Monitoring for Adversarial Inputs**: Implement logging and monitoring tools to detect and respond to unusual patterns in status updates that may indicate adversarial attacks.\n\n#### Interactive Reporting & Analytics\n- **Rate Limiting and Abuse Prevention**: Enforce rate limits on API calls related to reporting and analytics to mitigate abuse and potential DDoS attacks.\n- **Bias and Fairness Considerations**: Regularly audit models for bias and ensure fairness in reporting metrics, particularly when generating analytics that could influence decision-making.\n\n### 7.4. Integration with Existing Security Controls\nThe AI/ML security controls proposed above integrate with standard security practices such as:\n- **Session Security**: Maintaining secure sessions and implementing secure logout procedures ensures that AI/ML components are accessed only by authenticated users.\n- **Input Validation**: Existing input validation measures for user data should extend to inputs processed by AI components.\n- **Monitoring and Alerting**: Incorporate AI/ML monitoring requirements into broader system monitoring protocols to ensure that potential threats are identified and responded to in real-time.\n\n### 7.5. AI/ML Monitoring Requirements\n\n| Monitoring Area               | Description                                      |\n|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| Input Validation Logs         | Monitor logs for invalid or suspicious input patterns that could indicate prompt injection attempts. |\n| Model Performance Metrics      | Continuously track model performance and accuracy to identify potential model poisoning or degradation. |\n| Status Update Anomalies       | Alert on unusual patterns in real-time status updates that may suggest adversarial behavior. |\n| Access Control Audits         | Regular audits of access logs to ensure only authorized users interact with AI/ML components. |",
