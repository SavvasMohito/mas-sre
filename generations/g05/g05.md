Multi-Tenancy Private Cloud Management Platform Requirements

We need to build a web application for managing private cloud infrastructure with multi-tenant project isolation and comprehensive monitoring capabilities.

Key Features:

1. User and Policy Management
   - User registration and login through portal
   - Platform administrator registration
   - Register users to single or multiple isolated project spaces
   - Assign project roles (leader, admin, user) with standard policy rules per role
   - Support users registered to multiple projects with different roles
   - Per-user, per-project policy customization

2. Cloud Portal
   - User-friendly GUI to create, manage and administer cloud projects
   - Integrated notification, monitoring, analytics, ticketing, health and security systems

3. Project Creation
   - Registered users can create projects
   - Define project requirements (quotas, cloud resources, networks, locations)
   - Create project if available resources meet requirements

4. Cloud Resource Administration
   - Deploy or destroy project VNFs, CNFs, applications and networks
   - Set project credentials and access rules
   - Cloud and network monitoring and analytics
   - Ticketing system for requests to platform admin team

5. Platform Administration
   - Platform admins have access to all projects for support
   - Access to ticketing system to interact with project users
   - Access to full platform monitoring and analytics

6. Monitoring and Analytics
   - Monitor all systems within the platform
   - Automated notifications based on AI fault detection
   - Automated warnings for reaching system capacity
   - Dashboard with analytics selection

7. Health and Security System
   - Health and security checks across cloud, network, infrastructure and applications
   - Automated notification system flags risks and vulnerabilities
   - Dashboard with active flags

8. Notifications
   - Users receive notifications according to their roles and policies
   - Notifications displayed on portal page
   - Dashboard with full list of user notifications

The platform will manage multi-tenant cloud infrastructure with isolated project workspaces and comprehensive monitoring capabilities.
