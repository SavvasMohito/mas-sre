AI/ML Components Detected\nThis section identifies all AI/ML components within the system that require specialized security controls. \n\n1. **AI Fault Detection System**: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze system performance and detect anomalies that may indicate faults in the cloud infrastructure.\n2. **Automated Notification System**: Leverages AI to trigger alerts based on monitored metrics, including system capacity and health checks.\n3. **Health and Security Checks**: Incorporates AI-driven methods for vulnerability scanning and misconfiguration detection across the platform.\n\n### 7.2. AI/ML Threat Model\n\n| Component                     | Identified Threats                                         |\n|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| AI Fault Detection System      | - Prompt injection leading to false positives/negatives  |\n|                               | - Adversarial inputs that manipulate fault detection      |\n|                               | - Model poisoning through malicious training data         |\n| Automated Notification System   | - Data leakage of sensitive information via notifications |\n|                               | - Spam or denial-of-service through excessive alerts      |\n| Health and Security Checks      | - Model inversion attacks to extract sensitive training data |\n|                               | - Bias in detecting vulnerabilities leading to blind spots |\n\n### 7.3. AI/ML Security Controls  \n\n#### AI Fault Detection System\n- **Input Validation**: Ensure that all inputs to the AI system are thoroughly validated to prevent prompt injection attacks.\n- **Output Filtering and Sanitization**: Implement measures to sanitize AI outputs, preventing potentially harmful or misleading alerts.\n\n#### Automated Notification System\n- **Rate Limiting and Abuse Prevention**: Establish thresholds for notifications to prevent spam and denial-of-service attacks.\n- **Data Leakage Prevention**: Ensure no personally identifiable information (PII) is included in notifications sent through the platform.\n\n#### Health and Security Checks\n- **Model Access Controls**: Restrict access to AI models based on roles to prevent unauthorized manipulation.\n- **Monitoring for Adversarial Inputs**: Continuously monitor inputs to the health checks for signs of adversarial manipulation or model poisoning.\n- **Model Versioning and Rollback Capabilities**: Maintain version control for AI models, allowing quick rollback to previous stable versions in case of a detected compromise.\n\n### 7.4. Integration with Existing Security Controls\nAI controls are designed to integrate seamlessly with existing security practices, including role-based access control (RBAC), audit logging, and compliance features. The AI components will inherit the security measures already in place for user authentication, authorization, and data protection, ensuring a unified security posture across the platform.\n\n### 7.5. AI/ML Monitoring Requirements \n\n| Monitoring Area                | Description                                              |\n|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Anomaly Detection               | Monitor AI fault detection performance for accuracy and false positives. |\n| Notification System Activity    | Track the volume and type of notifications sent to prevent abuse. |\n| Health Check Integrity          | Regular audits of health and security checks to identify biases or inaccuracies. |\n| Model Performance               | Continuous evaluation of AI models for performance degradation or adversarial impacts. |",
