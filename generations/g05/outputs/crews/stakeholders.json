For instance, Platform Administrators have access to all project data for management purposes, while Project Leaders can only access and manage their respective projects. The principle of least privilege is implemented by granting users the minimum access rights necessary to perform their tasks, significantly minimizing the risk of data exposure and privilege escalation.
