Cross-functional controls (centralized logging, encryption/KMS, RBAC, secure ops) are appropriate and useful. Strengths include: good mapping to NIST/ISO/OWASP, explicit audit/logging and retention controls, AI/ML threat identification, and practical integration tips. Key gaps and recommended actions (actionable, prioritized): 1) Identity & Access Management maturity (High priority) - Add explicit controls/specs for: a) Enterprise SSO/federation (SAML/OIDC), SCIM for provisioning/deprovisioning, and how per-project roles map across federated identities; b) Mandatory MFA policy (administrators and project owners) and enforcement method (hardware tokens, TOTP, conditional MFA); c) Privileged Access Management (PAM) and Just-In-Time (JIT) elevation for platform admins with time-bound sessions and session recording. Acceptance criteria: documented SSO flows, SCIM endpoints, MFA enforcement tests, JIT workflow and logs. 2) Tenant isolation operational specifics (High priority) - Provide concrete isolation implementations and test requirements: a) Application-data model tenancy (tenant ID enforcement on every DB query, row-level/namespace isolation), b) Separate caches/sessions and secret stores per tenant or tenant-aware tagging, c) Backup/restore isolation and encryption keyed-per-tenant, d) Network microsegmentation (VLAN/VRF, NSGs), and verification tests for cross-tenant data leakage and lateral movement. Acceptance criteria: test cases demonstrating no cross-tenant access in active exploitation scenarios; documented backup isolation. 3) Secrets and Key Management specifics (High priority) - Strengthen KMS/HSM requirements: a) Key rotation cadence, split of duties for key administration, hardware-backed keys for root secrets, b) Secrets injection and redaction rules to avoid leaking secrets into logs/tickets, c) Short-lived credentials issuance (vaulted dynamic secrets). Acceptance criteria: KMS config, rotation schedule, sample IAM policies, secret-scan results. 4) CI/CD and Supply Chain Security (High priority) - Add controls for secure build/deployment: a) Signed artifacts, image scanning (SCA for dependencies, container images), immutability for production artifacts, b) Pipeline access RBAC and audit, c) Vulnerability gating (fail builds on critical issues) and SBOM production. Acceptance criteria: pipeline policy document, image scan reports, SBOM generation. 5) API/Platform robustness (Medium-High) - Add non-functional security controls: a) API rate-limiting, request throttling, anomaly detection, and DDoS mitigation design, b) WAF and API gateway requirements including authentication/authorization enforcement and request validation, c) Granular API scopes & refresh token revocation processes. Acceptance criteria: load/rate test results, WAF ruleset baseline, API gateway auth tests. 6) AI/ML governance (Medium priority) - Expand AI controls beyond input/output filtering: a) Model governance (training data lineage, provenance, access controls), b) Regular adversarial testing and poisoning detection, c) Explainability and confidence thresholds with human-in-the-loop escalation for high-risk actions, d) Audit trails for model changes and inference decisions. Acceptance criteria: model registry, versioning, threat-test reports, runbooks for false-positive/negative handling. 7) Incident response, forensics and DR (Medium priority) - Define IR playbooks, escalation paths, sandboxed test environments, and backup/restore validation: a) RTO/RPO targets, b) Forensic-ready logging and tamper-evidence for investigations, c) Regular red-team/pen-test schedule. Acceptance criteria: IR runbook, drill reports, RTO/RPO evidence. 8) Compliance/Residency enforcement (Medium priority) - Add technical enforcement of data residency: a) Geo-tagging of data and workloads, hard policy enforcement preventing cross-region replication, b) Export controls and tenant-level consent/records for data subject rights (erasure/portability automation). Acceptance criteria: policy configs enforcing geographic placement, automated DSAR workflows. 9) Monitoring & Telemetry privacy (Medium priority) - Ensure telemetry does not leak PII: a) PII detection and redaction processors in pipeline, b) retention mapping per tenant and per regulation, c) ticketing attachments controls and secure export workflows. Acceptance criteria: telemetry redaction tests, retention config, secure export logs. 10) Implementation specificity & testability (Medium priority) - Many controls are high-level; add explicit, measurable acceptance criteria for developers and QA: a) Enumerated test cases for RBAC, tenant isolation, API auth, secret handling, backup sanitization, and AI alerts; b) SLOs/SLAs for alerting, ticket response, and remediation timelines. Acceptance criteria: test suite matrix, SLO docs. Minor consistency/correctness notes: - A few NIST/ISO references were used at a high level; ensure mapping to specific control baselines used for compliance evidence (e.g., mapping to NIST SP 800-53 rev4/5 families or ISO annex references used in audits). - The \u201cprompt injection\u201d term in AI controls appears oriented to LLM prompts \u2014 if AI models are not LLMs, rephrase to \u201cinput manipulation/injection\u201d for clarity.
