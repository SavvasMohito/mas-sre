Integration connectors to customer infra (high risk) \u2014 these hold credentials and can execute provisioning; enforce least-privilege credentials, rotation, and isolation. Secrets Vault and KMS access (critical) \u2014 highly sensitive, restrict to service accounts and protected by HSM/KMS policies. Monitoring ingestion endpoints and observability APIs (medium risk) \u2014 can be abused to exfiltrate telemetry; restrict visibility by role and encrypt telemetry. Admin console and privileged operations (high risk) \u2014 require just-in-time elevation, session recording and privileged session controls. External notification integrations (low-medium risk) \u2014 risk of data leakage via misconfigured webhooks or SMS; enforce signing and output filtering. Exposed risks also include supply-chain of connectors and third-party libraries; mitigate with SBOM, vulnerability scanning and secure CI/CD. Overall prioritized mitigations: strong identity and access controls, encryption in transit and at rest, extensive audit logging, network segmentation, least-privilege connectors, input validation and WAF protections."
