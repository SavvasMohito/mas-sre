  "raw": "### 11.1. Testing Approach\nIntegrate security testing throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC) with an emphasis on continuous security practices. Balance automated scanning with manual evaluations to prioritize high-risk areas based on business impact, adhering to shift-left security principles by incorporating security testing earlier and continuously. This approach will enable early detection of vulnerabilities, enhance security awareness among developers, and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.\n\n### 11.2. Testing Methods\n| Method                                          | Frequency                  | Tools                                         |\n|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| STATIC APPLICATION SECURITY TESTING (SAST)     | Every commit/build         | SonarQube, Semgrep, Checkmarx, CodeQL       |\n| DYNAMIC APPLICATION SECURITY TESTING (DAST)    | Nightly/weekly            | OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, Acunetix             |\n| DEPENDENCY SCANNING                             | Every build               | Snyk, Dependabot, OWASP Dependency-Check     |\n| SECRETS SCANNING                                | Every commit              | TruffleHog, GitLeaks, GitHub Secret Scanning |\n| CONTAINER/INFRASTRUCTURE SCANNING              | Every deployment           | Trivy, Clair, Prowler, ScoutSuite            |\n| PENETRATION TESTING                             | Quarterly or before major releases | Custom scripts, Metasploit, Burp Suite Pro   |\n| SECURITY CODE REVIEW                            | For critical features     | GitHub/GitLab code review, security checklists |\n| COMPLIANCE SCANNING                             | Continuous                | AWS Config, Azure Policy, Cloud Custodian    |\n\n### 11.3. Compliance Verification\nMulti-standard compliance (OWASP ASVS, NIST SP 800-53, ISO 27001) will be verified through automated tools and manual checks against regulatory requirements such as GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS. Audit preparation will involve ensuring documentation and evidence collection for external audits, including logs, security configurations, and test results. Recommendations will include engaging third-party auditors for comprehensive evaluations to validate adherence to compliance controls and identify any gaps in security measures.\n\n### 11.4. Continuous Monitoring\nImplement Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) for real-time monitoring, supported by Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) to identify and mitigate threats. All logs will be aggregated and analyzed for anomalies, with integration into incident response processes to ensure prompt action against security events. Continuous monitoring will also include automated compliance checks and health scans to maintain security posture and compliance with applicable regulations.\n\n### 11.5. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)\n- Mean time to detect (MTTD) security issues  \n- Mean time to remediate (MTTR) vulnerabilities  \n- Percentage of critical vulnerabilities patched within SLA  \n- Security test coverage percentage  \n- False positive rate in automated scanning  \n- Compliance audit pass rate  \n\n### 11.6.
