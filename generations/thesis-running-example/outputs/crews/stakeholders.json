Trust Model\nTrust boundaries are established at the user interface, API gateway, backend services, and database levels. Security mechanisms enforcing these boundaries include user authentication (email/password, social login), role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure users can only access functionalities pertinent to their roles, and network segmentation to mitigate risks of unauthorized access. Customers can access their profiles and order history, while Admin Users have comprehensive access to management functionalities. Payment Processors can only access payment-related data, while external integrations (e.g., shipping carriers and analytics vendors) have access limited to the data necessary for their functions. The principle of least privilege is implemented by ensuring each role has the minimum necessary permissions to perform their tasks, thus reducing the risk of data exposure and privilege escalation. For example, Guest Users have access only to browsing and purchasing capabilities without account functionalities, limiting their potential impact on the system.",
