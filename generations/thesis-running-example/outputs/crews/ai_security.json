AI/ML Components Detected\nThis section identifies all AI/ML components within the system that require specialized security controls. \n\n1. **Chatbot Interface**: Natural language processing chatbot providing customer support using large language models.\n2. **Product Recommendation Engine**: Machine learning model suggesting products based on user browsing and purchase history.\n3. **Automated Product Categorization**: AI-driven system that automatically tags and categorizes products using machine learning algorithms.\n\n### 7.2. AI/ML Threat Model\n\n| Component                       | Identified Threats                                   |\n|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| Chatbot Interface               | - Prompt injection                                   |\n|                                 | - Adversarial inputs                                 |\n|                                 | - Data leakage (sensitive information exposure)     |\n| Product Recommendation Engine    | - Data leakage (PII in training data)               |\n|                                 | - Model inversion attacks                            |\n| Automated Product Categorization | - Model poisoning                                   |\n|                                 | - Bias and fairness considerations                  |\n\n### 7.3. AI/ML Security Controls \n\n#### **Chatbot Interface**\n- **Prompt Injection Prevention**: Implement input sanitization and validation to prevent malicious prompts from being processed by the model.\n- **Input Validation for AI Inputs**: Rigorously validate all user inputs to ensure they conform to expected formats, preventing harmful data from being processed.\n- **Output Filtering and Sanitization**: Filter and sanitize outputs generated by the model to prevent harmful or sensitive information from being exposed.\n\n#### **Product Recommendation Engine**\n- **Data Leakage Prevention**: Ensure that personal identifiable information (PII) is not used in the training data or inferred through the recommendations.\n- **Model Access Controls**: Implement strict access controls on the model to prevent unauthorized access and modifications.\n- **Monitoring for Adversarial Inputs**: Use anomaly detection systems to monitor for unusual patterns in input data that may indicate attempts to manipulate recommendations.\n\n#### **Automated Product Categorization**\n- **Model Versioning and Rollback Capabilities**: Maintain version control for all deployed models to facilitate quick rollback to previous versions in case of detected vulnerabilities.\n- **Supply Chain Security for Models**: Implement due diligence processes for third-party models and datasets to ensure they don\u2019t introduce vulnerabilities.\n- **Bias and Fairness Considerations**: Regularly audit the model for bias and implement fairness constraints during training and deployment.\n\n### 7.4. Integration with Existing Security Controls\nThe security controls for AI/ML components will integrate with standard security practices through:\n- Role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to sensitive AI features based on user roles.\n- Logging and monitoring to track any interactions with AI components, providing an audit trail for security events.\n- Data protection measures such as encryption for sensitive user data, both at rest and in transit, to prevent leakage through AI systems.\n\n### 7.5. AI/ML Monitoring Requirements\n\n| Monitoring Area                 | Description                                          |\n|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| Anomaly Detection               | Implement systems to detect unusual patterns in AI input that may indicate attempts at manipulation or abuse. |\n| Model Performance Monitoring     | Regularly assess model accuracy and fairness to ensure optimal performance and compliance with ethical standards. |\n| Access Logs                     | Maintain logs of all access to AI components for auditing and forensic analysis in case of security incidents. |\n| Data Usage Tracking             | Monitor and log how user data is utilized within AI models to ensure compliance with data protection regulations. |",
