AI-Powered Code Review and Security Analysis Platform Requirements

We need to build an AI-powered platform that automatically reviews code commits, identifies security vulnerabilities, and provides intelligent remediation suggestions for development teams.

Key Features:
1. Repository Integration

Connect to GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket repositories
OAuth-based authentication for repository access
Webhook integration for real-time commit monitoring
Support for multiple programming languages (Python, Java, JavaScript, Go, etc.)

2. AI-Powered Analysis Engine

LLM-based code review using fine-tuned models (GPT-4, CodeLlama, or custom models)
Static code analysis for vulnerability detection
Pattern recognition for common security anti-patterns
Dependency scanning for known CVEs
Secret detection in code and configuration files

3. Intelligent Remediation

AI-generated fix suggestions with code snippets
Automatic pull request creation with security fixes
Severity scoring and risk assessment
Context-aware explanations of vulnerabilities

4. Team Collaboration

Developer dashboards with personalized security metrics
Comment threads on identified issues
Integration with existing CI/CD pipelines
Slack/Teams notifications for critical findings

5. Compliance and Reporting

OWASP Top 10 compliance checking
Custom security policy enforcement
Audit logs of all security findings
Export reports for compliance documentation
Trend analysis of security posture over time

6. Model Management

API endpoints for model inference
Model versioning and A/B testing
Custom model training on organization's codebase
Model performance monitoring and drift detection

7. Data Handling

Process and store code snippets for analysis
Maintain vulnerability database
Store remediation history and patterns
Cache analysis results for performance

The platform will handle sensitive source code, authentication tokens, API keys, and potentially expose AI models through APIs. It requires integration with various third-party services, processes potentially proprietary code, and needs to maintain strict access controls while providing actionable security insights.
