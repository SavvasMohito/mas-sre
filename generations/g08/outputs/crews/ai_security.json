AI/ML Security Controls  \n#### LLM-based Code Review Engine  \n**Prompt Injection Prevention**: Implement strict input validation for all prompts sent to the model. Use whitelists for acceptable input patterns.  \n**Output Filtering and Sanitization**: Apply filtering mechanisms to sanitize outputs before displaying them to users, ensuring that potentially harmful content is removed.  \n\n#### Static Code Analysis Engine  \n**Input Validation for AI Inputs**: Enforce rigorous validation on all inputs to the static analysis engine to prevent injection attacks and malicious inputs.  \n**Data Leakage Prevention**: Ensure that proprietary or sensitive code is never included in training data. Use techniques like data anonymization.  \n\n#### AI-generated Remediation Suggestions  \n**Contextual Output Filtering**: Implement logic to ensure AI-generated suggestions are contextually relevant and accurate, reducing the risk of misleading fixes.  \n**Model Access Controls**: Enforce strict access controls to limit who can access and utilize the model for generating suggestions, preventing misuse.  \n\n#### Model Management System  \n**Model Versioning and Rollback Capabilities**: Maintain a comprehensive versioning system that allows for rollback to previous model versions in case of detected issues or vulnerabilities.  \n**Supply Chain Security for Models**: Implement checks and integrity verification for all models sourced externally to ensure they have not been tampered with.  \n\n### 7.4. Integration with Existing Security Controls  \nAI controls should be integrated into existing security practices such as the OWASP Top 10 compliance checks, ensuring that all AI-related components are assessed for vulnerabilities. Additionally, the use of standard authentication and access control measures (like OAuth and RBAC) can complement AI-specific controls to create a more robust security posture.\n\n### 7.5.
