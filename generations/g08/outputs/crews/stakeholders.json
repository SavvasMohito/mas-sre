Trust Model\n\nTrust boundaries are established at the user interface, API gateway, backend services, and data storage levels. Security mechanisms enforcing these boundaries include OAuth-based authentication for secure repository access, role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure users can only access data and functionalities pertinent to their roles, and network segmentation to limit exposure to critical services. Developers have access to their own repositories and analysis results, while Security Analysts can access vulnerability findings for remediation. System Administrators have comprehensive management access, while service accounts like CI/CD integrations and AI Model accounts operate under strict RBAC policies to minimize exposure. The principle of least privilege is implemented by ensuring that users and service accounts are granted only the permissions necessary for their specific tasks, effectively reducing the risk of unauthorized access and privilege escalation across the system.",
