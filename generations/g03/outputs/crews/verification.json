  "raw": "### 11.1. Testing Approach\nIntegrate security testing throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC) with an emphasis on continuous security practices. Balance automated scanning with manual evaluations to prioritize high-risk areas based on business impact, adhering to shift-left security principles by incorporating security testing earlier and continuously. This approach ensures that vulnerabilities are identified and resolved before they reach production, reducing overall risk and improving compliance with regulations.\n\n### 11.2. Testing Methods\n| Method                                             | Frequency                 | Tools                                           |\n|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| STATIC APPLICATION SECURITY TESTING (SAST)        | Every commit/build       | SonarQube, Semgrep, Checkmarx, CodeQL         |\n| DYNAMIC APPLICATION SECURITY TESTING (DAST)       | Nightly/weekly           | OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, Acunetix               |\n| DEPENDENCY SCANNING                                | Every build              | Snyk, Dependabot, OWASP Dependency-Check      |\n| SECRETS SCANNING                                   | Every commit             | TruffleHog, GitLeaks, GitHub Secret Scanning  |\n| CONTAINER/INFRASTRUCTURE SCANNING                 | Every deployment         | Trivy, Clair, Prowler, ScoutSuite              |\n| PENETRATION TESTING                                | Quarterly or before major releases | Custom scripts, Metasploit, Burp Suite Pro |\n| SECURITY CODE REVIEW                               | For critical features    | GitHub/GitLab code review, security checklists |\n| COMPLIANCE SCANNING                                | Continuous               | AWS Config, Azure Policy, Cloud Custodian      |\n\n### 11.3. Compliance Verification\nMulti-standard compliance (OWASP ASVS, NIST SP 800-53, ISO 27001) will be verified through automated tools and manual checks against regulatory requirements such as GDPR, CCPA, and PCI-DSS. Audit preparation will involve ensuring documentation and evidence collection for external audits, including logs, assessments, and compliance checklists. Recommendations will include engaging third-party auditors for comprehensive evaluations to verify adherence to all applicable legislation and best practices.\n\n### 11.4. Continuous Monitoring\nImplement Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) for real-time monitoring, supported by Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) to identify and mitigate threats. All logs will be aggregated and analyzed for anomalies, with integration into incident response processes to ensure prompt action against security events. This will facilitate continuous threat assessment and improve the organization\u2019s ability to respond to incidents effectively.\n\n### 11.5. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)\n- Mean time to detect (MTTD) security issues  \n- Mean time to remediate (MTTR) vulnerabilities  \n- Percentage of critical vulnerabilities patched within SLA  \n- Security test coverage percentage  \n- False positive rate in automated scanning  \n- Compliance audit pass rate  \n\n### 11.6. Mapping Testing Methods to Security Controls\n| Testing Method                                   | Security Controls (OWASP ASVS, NIST SP 800-53, ISO 27001) Verified |\n|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| STATIC APPLICATION SECURITY TESTING (SAST)      | Input validation, authentication, authorization, cryptographic protections, hardcoded secrets |\n| DYNAMIC APPLICATION SECURITY TESTING (DAST)     | Authentication, authorization, XSS, CSRF, SQL injection, session management |\n| DEPENDENCY SCANNING                              | Supply chain security, vulnerability management                        |\n| SECRETS SCANNING                                 | Cryptographic protection, secrets management                          |\n| CONTAINER/INFRASTRUCTURE SCANNING               | Configuration management, infrastructure security                      |\n| PENETRATION TESTING                              | All high-risk controls, business logic integrity                        |\n| SECURITY CODE REVIEW                             | Authentication, authorization, cryptographic implementations, data protection |\n| COMPLIANCE SCANNING                              | All compliance-related controls, auditing, access controls             |\n\nThis comprehensive security verification and testing strategy is designed to ensure a robust security posture throughout the software development lifecycle and maintain compliance with applicable regulations.",
