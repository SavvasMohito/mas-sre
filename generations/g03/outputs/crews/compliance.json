Compliance Controls by Regulation  \n#### GDPR  \n- Implement clear consent mechanisms for data processing.  \n- Ensure data minimization principles are followed (only collect necessary data).  \n- Enable data subject rights management (access, correction, deletion).  \n- Use encryption for data at rest and in transit.  \n\n#### CCPA  \n- Provide clear privacy notices regarding data collection and use.  \n- Allow users to opt out of the sale of their personal information.  \n- Implement mechanisms for users to request disclosure of their data.  \n- Ensure appropriate training for staff handling personal data.  \n\n#### PCI-DSS  \n- Encrypt cardholder data during transmission.  \n- Maintain a secure network with firewalls and security protocols.  \n- Restrict access to cardholder data on a need-to-know basis.  \n- Regularly monitor and test networks for vulnerabilities.  \n\n#### COPPA  \n- Obtain verifiable parental consent for users under 13.  \n- Provide clear information about data collection practices for minors.  \n- Implement age verification mechanisms during account creation.  \n\n#### Data Residency Laws  \n- Identify data storage locations to ensure compliance with local regulations.  \n- Implement data transfer restrictions based on jurisdictional requirements.  \n\n### 8.3. Data Subject Rights  \n| Right                     | Description                                           |\n|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|\n| Right to Access           | Users can request access to their personal data.      |\n| Right to Rectification    | Users can request corrections to inaccurate data.      |\n| Right to Erasure          | Users can request deletion of their personal data.     |\n| Right to Data Portability  | Users can request to receive their data in a structured format. |\n| Right to Restrict Processing | Users can request to limit the processing of their data. |\n\n### 8.4. Privacy Requirements  \n**Consent:** Users must provide explicit consent for data collection, processing, and sharing.  \n**Privacy Notice:** Clear and accessible privacy notices must inform users about data handling practices.  \n**Data Protection Impact Assessment:** Conduct assessments to evaluate risks associated with data processing activities.  \n\n### 8.5. Audit and Monitoring Requirements  \n**Logging:** Maintain detailed logs of data access and modifications by users and administrators.  \n**Monitoring:** Regular audits to ensure compliance with security and privacy controls.  \n**Incident Response Plan:** Develop and implement a plan for responding to data breaches and security incidents.  \n\n### 8.6. Data Handling Rules  \n**Retention:** Data should only be retained for as long as necessary for the purposes for which it was collected.  \n**Deletion:** Implement processes for securely deleting data once it is no longer needed.  \n**Access Controls:** Limit access to personal data to authorized individuals only.  \n\n### 8.7. Compliance Risk Assessment  \nThe compliance risk assessment identifies potential risks associated with failing to adhere to applicable regulations. It is essential to recognize these risks to implement effective control measures and protect user data.  \n\n**Key Compliance Risks:**  \n\n- Non-compliance with GDPR and CCPA, leading to potential fines and legal action.  \n- Inadequate protection of payment card data under PCI-DSS, resulting in financial loss and reputational damage.  \n- Failure to obtain necessary consent for the collection of children's data under COPPA, leading to legal repercussions.  \n- Data breaches due to insufficient security measures, impacting user trust and compliance standing.",
