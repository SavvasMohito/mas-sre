AI/ML Security Controls  \n\n#### Automated Moderation System  \n**Prompt Injection Prevention**: Implement context-aware filtering to ensure inputs do not exploit the system.  \n**Data Leakage Prevention**: Regularly audit training data to ensure no sensitive PII is present.  \n**Output Filtering and Sanitization**: Strip sensitive or harmful information from outputs before display.  \n\n#### In-app Messaging System  \n**Input Validation for AI Inputs**: Validate and sanitize all messages to prevent harmful injections.  \n**Model Access Controls**: Limit access to the NLP models used for messaging to authorized personnel only.  \n**Monitoring for Adversarial Inputs**: Use anomaly detection algorithms to flag unusual patterns in messaging.  \n\n#### Search and Filtering Mechanism  \n**Rate Limiting and Abuse Prevention**: Implement rate limits on search queries to prevent abuse of system resources.  \n**Monitoring for Adversarial Inputs**: Regularly update the filtering algorithms to identify and mitigate adversarial manipulation of search results.  \n**Bias and Fairness Considerations**: Continuously evaluate and adjust the model to avoid biased recommendations based on user data.  \n\n### 7.4. Integration with Existing Security Controls  \nAI security controls will integrate with existing practices such as encryption, role-based access control (RBAC), and GDPR compliance measures. For instance, outputs from the AI components will be encrypted to protect sensitive data, and user roles will dictate access levels to AI functionalities, ensuring that only authorized users can modify or interact with these systems.\n\n### 7.5.
