Trust Model\nTrust boundaries are established at the user interface, backend server, and database levels. Security mechanisms enforcing boundaries include user authentication (email/password and domain verification), role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure users can only access data and functionalities pertinent to their roles, and network segmentation to mitigate risks of unauthorized access. Advertisers can only manage their own listings, Seekers have access to search and view adverts, Moderators can approve or reject submissions, and Administrators have comprehensive management capabilities. The principle of least privilege is implemented by granting users the minimum access necessary to perform their responsibilities, thereby reducing the risk of data exposure and privilege escalation. For example, a Seeker can only view and communicate about adverts, while an Administrator has full control over user accounts and content moderation functions.",
