Student Household Vacancy Platform Requirements

We need to build a geo-centric platform for advertising and discovering vacancies in student households (sharehouses) and for finding potential housemates. The system will prioritise location-based information while ensuring user security and privacy.
Key Features:

1. User Management

Account creation and secure login.
User profiles with role assignments (Advertiser, Seeker, Moderator, Administrator).
Email domain filtering for free-tier advertisers (e.g., only university email addresses).
Paid-tier access for agencies, hostels, and temporary accommodation providers.

2. Advert Management

Submit, edit, and delete adverts for properties and rooms.
Each property can include multiple rooms with individual details (cost, size, availability).
Automatic filtering and moderation system to detect spam and malicious content before publication.
Adverts are not immediately active; require approval by moderators or automated checks.
Rich advert details including:

Location (approximate, not exact address for security).
Room specifications (size, furnishings, amenities, cost, deposit).
Household preferences (smoking, pets, occupation, age range, language, vegetarian preference).
Availability dates and minimum/maximum stay.
Bills and broadband inclusion.

3. Search and Filtering

Geo-centric search with approximate location visualisation (e.g., neighbourhood or postcode area).
Advanced filters: price range, distance from a specific point, number of housemates, amenities, stay duration.
Ability to save filter sets and searches.
Email alerts for new adverts matching saved criteria (daily digest and instant notifications).

4. Favourites and Personalisation

Users can “favourite” properties or rooms.
Generate a personalised summary list of saved adverts.
Option to manage and organise favourites within the user dashboard.

5. Collaboration and Communication

Secure in-app messaging between advertisers and seekers.
No direct contact details displayed publicly; communication mediated through the platform.
Optional display of phone number/email for verified users.


6. Visualisation

Interactive map showing approximate locations of properties.
Clustered view for areas with multiple adverts.
No exact addresses displayed, only general vicinity, for general safety of advertises.
