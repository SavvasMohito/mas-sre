AI-Powered ML Workflow Management Web Application Requirements

We need to build a modern web application that helps teams manage machine learning workflows, experiments, and model deployments through an intuitive browser-based interface with an integrated AI assistant.

Key Features:

1. User Management & Authentication
   - User registration and login with email/password or social OAuth (Google, GitHub)
   - Single sign-on (SSO) via OIDC/SAML for enterprise customers
   - Role-based access control: Admin, Project Manager, Data Scientist, Viewer
   - Team workspaces with shared projects and permissions
   - User profile management with avatar uploads and preferences
   - Two-factor authentication (2FA) support

2. Project & Experiment Management
   - Create and organize ML projects with descriptions and tags
   - Track experiments with versioning, metrics, and visualizations
   - Compare multiple experiments side-by-side in the web UI
   - Save and share experiment configurations as templates
   - Project-level access controls and sharing settings
   - Activity feed showing project changes and updates

3. AI Assistant Powered by LLM
   - Conversational AI assistant accessible via chat interface in the web app
   - Natural language queries to search experiments, models, and data
   - AI-powered code suggestions and explanations for ML workflows
   - Automated insights and recommendations based on experiment results
   - Context-aware help that understands current project and user role
   - AI-generated experiment summaries and reports
   - Chat history saved per user with ability to export conversations
   - Multi-language support for the AI assistant

4. Data Management & Visualization
   - Upload and manage datasets through web interface
   - Preview data tables, images, and structured data in browser
   - Interactive charts and graphs for experiment metrics
   - Custom dashboard creation with drag-and-drop widgets
   - Export visualizations as images or PDFs
   - Data versioning and lineage tracking

5. Model Registry & Deployment
   - Register trained models with metadata, versions, and descriptions
   - Model comparison interface showing performance metrics
   - Deploy models to staging and production environments via UI
   - Model monitoring dashboard showing prediction accuracy and drift
   - A/B testing interface for comparing model versions
   - Model card generation with AI assistance

6. Collaboration & Sharing
   - Share projects and experiments with team members
   - Comment and discuss experiments with threaded conversations
   - @mention notifications for team collaboration
   - Real-time collaboration on shared projects
   - Export projects and experiments as shareable reports
   - Public project showcase for sharing work externally

The web application will be a browser-first platform that stores user accounts, project data, experiment metadata, model artifacts, chat conversations with the AI assistant, and audit logs. It will integrate with external ML platforms and cloud storage services through secure APIs.
