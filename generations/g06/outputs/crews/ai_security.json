AI/ML Security Controls  \n\n#### Conversational AI Assistant (LLM)  \n- **Prompt Injection Prevention**: Implement strict validation of user inputs to prevent malicious prompts. Use a whitelist approach to allow only safe commands.  \n- **Output Filtering and Sanitization**: Sanitize outputs generated by the AI to remove sensitive information and ensure compliance with data protection regulations.  \n- **Rate Limiting and Abuse Prevention**: Monitor and limit the frequency of requests to the AI assistant to mitigate abuse and ensure fair usage among users.  \n\n#### Experiment Tracking and Insights  \n- **Input Validation for AI Inputs**: Validate inputs to the AI system to prevent injection attacks and ensure that only expected data formats are processed.  \n- **Model Access Controls**: Develop strict access controls around who can view or modify experiment data and insights to protect proprietary information.  \n- **Monitoring for Adversarial Inputs**: Implement monitoring mechanisms to detect unusual patterns or inputs that could indicate adversarial attacks on the model.  \n\n#### Model Monitoring Dashboard  \n- **Model Versioning and Rollback Capabilities**: Ensure that all models are versioned, allowing rollback to a previous stable state in case of detected anomalies or poisoning.  \n- **Supply Chain Security for Models**: Implement checks to verify the integrity of models and datasets sourced from external providers to prevent supply chain attacks.  \n- **Bias and Fairness Considerations**: Regularly audit models for bias and implement fairness checks to ensure equitable outcomes across diverse user groups.  \n\n### 7.4. Integration with Existing Security Controls  \nAI controls integrate with standard security practices by complementing user authentication methods (like 2FA) to secure access to sensitive AI components. Additionally, regular audits and logging mechanisms established for general application security will also encompass AI-specific logs for monitoring model performance and detecting anomalies. Data retention and compliance workflows for PII will be extended to cover AI-generated data and interactions, ensuring comprehensive protection.\n\n### 7.5.
