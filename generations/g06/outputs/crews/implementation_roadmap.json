Prioritization Framework\n\nPrioritization is critical for effective security implementation as it ensures that the most critical risks are addressed first, compliance deadlines are met, and resources are efficiently allocated. By prioritizing security controls, the organization can strategically mitigate risks, adhere to regulatory requirements, and align security initiatives with business objectives.\n\n**Prioritization Criteria:**\n\n- **Risk Level**: Controls addressing critical and high-risk threats (identified through threat modeling) are prioritized first.\n- **Compliance Deadlines**: Regulatory requirements and compliance deadlines influence immediate priority.\n- **Technical Complexity**: Controls requiring foundational infrastructure are implemented early to enable subsequent controls.\n- **Dependencies**: Controls that other security measures depend upon are prioritized accordingly.\n- **Resource Availability**: Implementation considers the availability of skilled personnel, tools, and budget.\n- **Business Impact**: Controls protecting business-critical functions and data receive higher priority.\n\nThese criteria work together to create a logical implementation sequence that balances security needs with practical constraints, ensuring that the most pressing risks are mitigated first while building a robust security foundation for future enhancements.\n\n### 10.2. Phased Implementation Plan\n\n#### Phase: IMMEDIATE\n\n**Timeline:** 0-1 months\n\n**Rationale:** This phase addresses critical vulnerabilities and compliance blockers that could expose the organization to immediate threats or legal penalties. It establishes essential security baselines.\n\n**Controls to Implement:**\n\n- Implement strong 2FA (FIDO2/TOTP) for all user logins.\n- Secure session cookies with HttpOnly, Secure, and SameSite=strict attributes.\n- Apply PKCE for OAuth flows and validate OAuth state and redirect_uris.\n- Establish secure storage and encryption for sensitive data (e.g., AES-256).\n- Address XSS vulnerabilities by deploying a strict Content Security Policy (CSP).\n- Secure API gateway with rate limiting and bot detection mechanisms.\n\n**Dependencies:**\n\n- None\n\n#### Phase: SHORT-TERM\n\n**Timeline:** 1-3 months\n\n**Rationale:** These controls build upon immediate security measures, focusing on improving access control adjustments and ensuring that logging and API security mitigate identified threats effectively.\n\n**Controls to Implement:**\n\n- Enhance user authentication through comprehensive multi-factor authentication.\n- Deploy role-based access controls across the admin dashboard.\n- Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring for all administrative actions.\n- Strengthen API security with input validation and HTTPS protocols.\n- Begin encryption for all sensitive data at rest.\n\n**Dependencies:**\n\n- Completion of TLS Implementation\n- Completion of multi-factor authentication\n\n#### Phase: MEDIUM-TERM\n\n**Timeline:** 3-6 months\n\n**Rationale:** This phase focuses on advanced security measures that require more planning and integration, such as threat detection and third-party security audits.\n\n**Controls to Implement:**\n\n- Implement advanced threat detection systems and SIEM integration.\n- Automate security testing and vulnerability scanning in CI/CD pipelines.\n- Conduct third-party security audits and penetration testing.\n- Enhance data protection with additional encryption layers and key management.\n\n**Dependencies:**\n\n- Completion of access control enhancements\n- Deployment of logging and monitoring systems\n\n#### Phase: LONG-TERM\n\n**Timeline:** 6-12 months\n\n**Rationale:** Strategic initiatives and continuous improvement efforts are prioritized to enhance security maturity and address emerging threats.\n\n**Controls to Implement:**\n\n- Develop security maturity enhancements and continuous improvement plans.\n- Implement advanced AI/ML security controls to safeguard against evolving threats.\n- Conduct comprehensive penetration testing and red-team exercises.\n- Launch security awareness and training programs for all employees.\n\n**Dependencies:**\n\n- Completion of advanced threat detection systems\n- Integration of third-party audit recommendations\n\n#### Phase: ONGOING\n\n**Timeline:** Continuous\n\n**Rationale:** These controls are essential for maintaining security effectiveness and compliance over time, ensuring readiness to respond to incidents and evolving threats.\n\n**Controls to Implement:**\n\n- Conduct continuous security monitoring and incident response readiness.\n- Maintain regular patch management and vulnerability assessments.\n- Perform periodic compliance audits and reviews.\n- Update and refine security policies and procedures based on lessons learned.\n\n**Dependencies:**\n\n- Implementation of foundational security controls\n- Establishment of security monitoring infrastructure\n\n### 10.3.
