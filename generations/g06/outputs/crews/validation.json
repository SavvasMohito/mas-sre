Authentication, SSO, RBAC/ABAC, data protection (encryption, retention, DSAR), logging/audit, AI-specific concerns (prompt injection, output filtering, model governance), and integration/adapters are all addressed with applicable standards and practical integration tips. Strengths include: clear mapping to OWASP/NIST/ISO controls, AI/ML threat model and monitoring requirements, and cross-functional controls (KMS, centralized logging, ABAC). Recommended improvements (actionable, prioritized): 1) Tenant isolation & multi-tenancy hardening (Priority: High) - Add explicit controls for logical and physical multi-tenant isolation: per-tenant storage buckets, per-tenant encryption keys (KMS tenant-scoped keys), strict resource tagging and enforcement, network segmentation, and cross-tenant access tests. Acceptance criteria: per-tenant secrets and storage separation implemented and tested; cross-tenant access attempts are blocked and logged. 2) Perimeter protection & availability (Priority: High) - Add WAF, API gateway protections, DDoS mitigation, and layered rate limiting (global and per-user/project) for APIs and AI assistant endpoints. Acceptance criteria: WAF rulesets deployed, DDoS protection configured, rate-limits enforced and load-tested. 3) CI/CD and supply chain security (Priority: High) - Expand CI/CD controls: signed artifacts, SLSA/attestation for build provenance, SCA (software composition analysis), container image signing, and secure secret injection for pipelines. Acceptance criteria: artifact signing verified in deployments, SCA in pipeline with fail-on-high findings, secrets stored and injected via vault with short-lived access. 4) Vulnerability & patch management, secure SDLC (Priority: Medium) - Specify SAST/DAST, dependency scanning cadence, pentests, and acceptance gates in CI. Define vulnerability SLAs and tracking. Acceptance criteria: SAST/DAST integrated in CI, monthly dependency scans, documented SLA for vulnerability remediation. 5) Runtime protection & host/container hardening (Priority: Medium) - Add controls for container runtime security (CIS benchmarks, Pod security policies / CSPs), RASP/monitoring for model-serving hosts, and endpoint detection on critical hosts. Acceptance criteria: CIS hardened images, runtime policies preventing privilege escalation, EDR telemetry collection enabled. 6) Secrets management specifics (Priority: Medium) - Expand KMS usage: hardware-backed keys where appropriate, strict key rotation policies, per-service/service-account key usage, and logging of key access. Acceptance criteria: KMS rotation schedule documented and enforced; key access audited. 7) AI/ML-specific technical mitigations (Priority: High) - Make AI controls more prescriptive: implement prompt/response sanitization libraries, context-scoping boundary to prevent model seeing unrelated tenant data, automatic redaction of secrets in inputs, human-in-the-loop gating for high-risk outputs, model extraction/ownership detection, adversarial testing and red-teaming schedule, and privacy-preserving techniques (differential privacy, watermarking model outputs where appropriate). Acceptance criteria: redaction library in place, LLM inputs evaluated against tenant-scope policy, red-team/attack exercises scheduled and remediated. 8) Incident response & runbooks for AI incidents (Priority: High) - Define IR playbooks for data leakage via AI outputs, model poisoning, and supply chain compromise. Include detection, containment, rollback, and disclosure steps. Acceptance criteria: IR playbooks exist and tested via tabletop exercises. 9) Clarify retention/secure deletion propagation (Priority: Medium) - Define and document deletion propagation to backups/archives, retention timelines by asset type (chat, artifacts, models), and cryptographic erasure strategies. Acceptance criteria: deletion workflow removes primary and archived copies or uses cryptographic erasure; DSAR tests pass. 10) Monitoring/alerting coverage & SLOs (Priority: Medium) - Define SIEM correlation rules for AI anomalies, model drift thresholds, suspicious search/query patterns, and alerts tied to incident processes. Acceptance criteria: alert playbooks wired to on-call and SIEM; simulated anomalies generate alerts. 11) Compliance evidence & governance (Priority: Medium) - Add explicit evidence artifacts: DPIAs for LLM use, model cards with classification and approved exposure levels, supplier risk assessments for third-party models/providers. Acceptance criteria: DPIAs completed for high-risk features; supplier assessments recorded. 12) Data minimization for external LLM calls (Priority: High) - Explicitly require minimizing PII/context sent to third-party LLMs and mandate contractual protections (BAAs, DPA) and logging of model calls. Acceptance criteria: PII scrubbing before external calls; contracts in place for third-party LLM providers. 13) Clarify export/security of generated artifacts (Priority: Medium) - Define controls for exported PDFs/images to strip metadata, watermark as necessary, and prevent leaking inaccessible content. Acceptance criteria: exports sanitized and validated against permission model prior to delivery. Suggested next steps: - Prioritize top 5 items (tenant isolation, perimeter protection, CI/CD supply chain, AI-specific mitigations, IR/runbooks) and create epics with acceptance criteria for the engineering and security teams. - Update the requirement mappings to include those missing controls with standards and verification methods (e.g., add SLSA, CIS, Cloud provider isolation controls). - Run a focused gap remediation sprint with defined test cases (cross-tenant access, prompt injection red-team, deployment signature verification, DSAR deletion validation).
