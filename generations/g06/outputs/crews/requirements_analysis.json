File upload pipeline (dataset/artifact uploads) presents malware and exfiltration risk \u2014 require virus scanning, content-type validation, PII/PHI detection, and staging quarantine. AI Assistant and LLM integrations expose potential data leakage and prompt injection risks \u2014 use context redaction, allowlist/blocklist, response filtering, prompt integrity checks, per-tenant opt-outs and logging. Integration adapters (cloud storage, external ML infra, CI/CD) and webhooks are lateral movement vectors \u2014 enforce least privilege, scoped tokens, IP allowlists and robust auditing. Realtime collaboration endpoints (WebSocket/RTC) require authentication and message size/validation controls to avoid abuse and data leakage. Exposed telemetry/monitoring endpoints must be authenticated and rate-limited to prevent information disclosure. Overall risk levels: Authentication & data storage (Critical), API surface & integrations (High), AI assistant & LLM paths (High), File upload & preview (High), Realtime/notifications (Medium), Public project showcase/export features (Medium) \u2014 mitigations include strong encryption, RBAC, tenant isolation, KMS/BYOK, privacy controls, input/output sanitization, SIEM integration and incident response runbooks."

Authentication flows and SSO endpoints (OIDC/SAML/social) are critical compromise targets \u2014 use hardened libraries, signature validation, JWS/JWT checks and monitoring. File upload pipeline (dataset/artifact uploads) presents malware and exfiltration risk \u2014 require virus scanning, content-type validation, PII/PHI detection, and staging quarantine. AI Assistant and LLM integrations expose potential data leakage and prompt injection risks \u2014 use context redaction, allowlist/blocklist, response filtering, prompt integrity checks, per-tenant opt-outs and logging. Integration adapters (cloud storage, external ML infra, CI/CD) and webhooks are lateral movement vectors \u2014 enforce least privilege, scoped tokens, IP allowlists and robust auditing. Realtime collaboration endpoints (WebSocket/RTC) require authentication and message size/validation controls to avoid abuse and data leakage. Exposed telemetry/monitoring endpoints must be authenticated and rate-limited to prevent information disclosure. Overall risk levels: Authentication & data storage (Critical), API surface & integrations (High), AI assistant & LLM paths (High), File upload & preview (High), Realtime/notifications (Medium), Public project showcase/export features (Medium) \u2014 mitigations include strong encryption, RBAC, tenant isolation, KMS/BYOK, privacy controls, input/output sanitization, SIEM integration and incident response runbooks."
