Shift Management System Requirements

We need to build a web application for managing employee shifts, assignments, and scheduling with automated optimization capabilities.

Key Features:

1. User Management
  - User registration with email verification
  - Authentication (credentials and Google OAuth)
  - Password reset
  - Role-based access control (ADMIN, MANAGER, EMPLOYEE)
  - User status management (ACTIVE, INACTIVE, UNVERIFIED)
  - User profile management
  - Admin/Manager user CRUD (a manager can CRUD only his company’s employees)
  - Company assignment for users
2. Company Management
  - Company CRUD (Admin only)
  - Multi-tenant support (users, shift types, skills scoped to companies)
  - Company assignment for managers and employees
3. Shift Types
  - Create, read, update, delete shift types
  - Define start and end times
  - Associate required skills with shift types
  - Company-scoped shift types
4. Shift Assignment
  - Manual shift assignment (create, update, delete)
  - Shift status tracking (SCHEDULED, CONFIRMED, COMPLETED, CANCELLED, NO_SHOW)
  - Calendar view for shifts
  - Shift filtering and search (by user, shift type, status, date)
  - Pagination and sorting
  - Shift preview on a calendar view
5. Auto-Assignment (Optimization)
  - Automated shift assignment via external solver API
  - Date range selection for auto-assignment
  - Real-time solution polling and status updates
  - Solution scoring (hard/soft constraints)
  - Constraint violation analysis and reporting
  - Preview of generated assignments before acceptance
  - Accept/reject generated assignments
  - Validation to prevent duplicate shifts in date ranges
6. Shift Preferences
  - Date-specific preferences (DESIRED/UNDESIRED)
  - Employee preference management
  - Preference tracking for optimization
7. Unavailable Dates
  - Leave management (SICK_LEAVE, VACATION, PERSONAL_LEAVE, UNPAID_LEAVE, OTHER)
  - Date range unavailability
  - Reason tracking
  - Employee and manager access
8. Skills Management
  - Skill CRUD
  - Associate skills with users
  - Associate required skills with shift types
  - Skill-based matching for shift assignments
  - Company-scoped skills
9. Data Export
  - Export shifts, users, companies, skills, shift types, preferences, and unavailable dates
  - Export formats: CSV and XLSX
10.  External API Integration
  - Integration with external optimization solver (Timefold backend)
  - Asynchronous job processing with polling
  - Solution status tracking
  - Constraint analysis via external API
  - Payload generation for solver
  - Solution parsing and validation
11. Internationalization
   - Multi-language support
   - Translated UI elements
   - Localized date/time formatting

12. User Interface
   - Responsive sidebar navigation
   - Pagination for data tables
   - Sorting and filtering
   - Search functionality
   - Calendar views
   - Alert/notification system
   - Breadcrumb navigation
   - Legal documents (Privacy Policy, Terms of Service)

The application will store user data, company information, shift assignments, preferences, and integration data. It will integrate with external optimization services and support multi-tenant company workspaces.
