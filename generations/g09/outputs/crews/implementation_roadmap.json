This approach ensures that the most critical vulnerabilities and compliance obligations are addressed promptly, enabling a structured path toward holistic security maturity. Each criterion was carefully considered to ensure a comprehensive and efficient implementation plan.\n\n**Prioritization Criteria:**\n\n- **Risk Level**: Controls addressing critical and high-risk threats (identified through threat modeling) are prioritized first\n\n- **Compliance Deadlines**: Regulatory requirements and compliance deadlines influence immediate priority\n\n- **Technical Complexity**: Controls requiring foundational infrastructure are implemented early to enable subsequent controls\n\n- **Dependencies**: Controls that other security measures depend upon are prioritized accordingly\n\n- **Resource Availability**: Implementation considers the availability of skilled personnel, tools, and budget\n\n- **Business Impact**: Controls protecting business-critical functions and data receive higher priority\n\nThese criteria work together to create a logical implementation sequence that balances security needs with practical constraints, ensuring that each phase builds on the previous one, addressing the most pressing risks while setting the stage for long-term security improvements.\n\n### 10.2.
