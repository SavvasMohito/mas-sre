AI/ML Security Controls  \n\n#### Automated Shift Assignment  \n**Prompt Injection Prevention**: Implement strict input validation to ensure that inputs to the external solver do not contain malicious commands or unexpected data formats.  \n**Input Validation for AI Inputs**: Validate all user inputs against a predefined schema to prevent injection attacks.  \n**Output Filtering and Sanitization**: Sanitize outputs from the optimization solver to ensure that no sensitive data is leaked in the response.  \n**Data Leakage Prevention**: Use encryption to protect sensitive user data that might be included in prompts sent to the external solver.  \n**Model Access Controls**: Restrict access to the optimization API to authorized users and services only.  \n**Rate Limiting and Abuse Prevention**: Implement rate limiting on requests to the external solver to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks.  \n\n#### Optimization Scoring and Reporting  \n**Monitoring for Adversarial Inputs**: Set up monitoring to detect unusual patterns in scoring requests that might indicate adversarial behavior.  \n**Model Versioning and Rollback Capabilities**: Maintain version control of the optimization model to allow quick rollbacks to previous safe versions if vulnerabilities are detected.  \n**Supply Chain Security for Models**: Vet and verify the security posture of third-party optimization solver providers.  \n**Bias and Fairness Considerations**: Regularly audit the scoring algorithm for fairness and bias, ensuring that outputs do not favor any group over another.  \n\n### 7.4. Integration with Existing Security Controls  \nAI/ML security controls should be integrated with existing security practices such as role-based access control, secure API management, and regular security audits. The automated shift assignment and scoring components should be monitored as part of the overall application security monitoring strategy, ensuring that standard practices for logging, incident response, and data protection extend to AI/ML functionalities.\n\n### 7.5.
