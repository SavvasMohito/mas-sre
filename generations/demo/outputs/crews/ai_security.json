AI/ML Security Controls  \n\n#### Chatbot Interface  \n**Prompt Injection Prevention**: Implement strict input validation and sanitization of user inputs to prevent malicious prompts from being executed.  \n**Input Validation for AI Inputs**: Ensure all inputs to the chatbot are validated against a defined schema to mitigate injection threats.  \n**Output Filtering and Sanitization**: Filter and sanitize outputs generated by the LLM to remove any sensitive information or inappropriate content.  \n**Model Access Controls**: Restrict access to the underlying model to only authorized services and personnel.  \n\n#### Product Recommendation System  \n**Data Leakage Prevention**: Implement mechanisms to ensure that sensitive user data is not included in the training dataset.  \n**Monitoring for Adversarial Inputs**: Establish monitoring systems to detect unusual patterns in input that may indicate adversarial attacks.  \n**Bias and Fairness Considerations**: Regularly audit the model for bias and implement fairness considerations in training and evaluation.  \n\n#### Automated Product Categorization  \n**Model Versioning and Rollback Capabilities**: Maintain version control of the model to enable rollback in case of detected vulnerabilities.  \n**Supply Chain Security for Models**: Ensure that models are sourced from trusted suppliers and undergo regular security assessments.  \n**Rate Limiting and Abuse Prevention**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of the categorization service through excessive requests.  \n\n### 7.4. Integration with Existing Security Controls  \nAI/ML security controls integrate with standard security practices by ensuring that they align with existing mechanisms for user authentication, data privacy, and incident response. For instance, the implementation of multi-factor authentication for API access to AI components enhances security. Additionally, regular audits and monitoring for both traditional and AI components ensure consistency in security posture across the platform.\n\n### 7.5. AI/ML Monitoring Requirements  \n\n| Monitoring Area                       | Description                                                   |\n|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Input Monitoring                      | Track and analyze inputs to the chatbot for anomalies.       |\n| Output Monitoring                     | Review outputs from AI components for inappropriate content.  |\n| Model Performance Monitoring          | Monitor the accuracy and fairness of AI models over time.    |\n| Access Logs                          | Maintain logs of access to AI components for auditing.       |\n| User Behavior Analytics               | Analyze user interactions with AI features for potential abuse. |",
