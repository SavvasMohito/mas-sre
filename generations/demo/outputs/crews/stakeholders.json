Guests have limited access, primarily to browse the product catalog, while third-party service accounts for payment processors and shipping carriers have restricted permissions to access only the data necessary for their operations. \n\nThe principle of least privilege is implemented by granting users the minimum necessary access required for their roles, thereby reducing the risk of data exposure and privilege escalation.
