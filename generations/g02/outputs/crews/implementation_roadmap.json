Prioritization Framework\n\nPrioritization is critical for effective security implementation as it ensures that the most significant risks and compliance requirements are addressed first, optimizing resource allocation and reducing the likelihood of breaches. Here's how we prioritize:\n\n**Prioritization Criteria:**\n\n- **Risk Level**: Controls addressing critical and high-risk threats (identified through threat modeling) are prioritized first\n\n- **Compliance Deadlines**: Regulatory requirements and compliance deadlines influence immediate priority\n\n- **Technical Complexity**: Controls requiring foundational infrastructure are implemented early to enable subsequent controls\n\n- **Dependencies**: Controls that other security measures depend upon are prioritized accordingly\n\n- **Resource Availability**: Implementation considers the availability of skilled personnel, tools, and budget\n\n- **Business Impact**: Controls protecting business-critical functions and data receive higher priority\n\nThese criteria work together to create a logical implementation sequence that balances security needs with practical constraints, ensuring that the most pressing security gaps are filled quickly while laying the groundwork for future controls.\n\n### 10.2.
