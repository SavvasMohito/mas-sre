Security mechanisms enforcing boundaries include user authentication via email/password and optional multi-factor authentication (MFA), role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure users can only access data and functionalities pertinent to their roles, and network segmentation to mitigate risks of unauthorized access. Patients can only access their personal medical records and upload their blood tests; Healthcare Providers have access to patient records they are actively treating and can view the analytical outputs; System Administrators have access to comprehensive management functions, including user management and system settings. The principle of least privilege is implemented by granting users the minimum access necessary to perform their responsibilities, thereby reducing the risk of data exposure and privilege escalation. For instance, while a patient may view their own test results, they cannot access other patients' data; similarly, Healthcare Providers can only access records of patients they are treating, which helps maintain strict confidentiality and compliance with health regulations.",
