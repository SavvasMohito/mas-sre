AI/ML Security Controls  \n\n#### AI Data Extraction and Analysis  \n- **Prompt Injection Prevention**: Implement input sanitization to filter out potentially harmful inputs before processing.  \n- **Input Validation for AI Inputs**: Ensure that all inputs conform to expected formats and ranges before they are processed by AI components.  \n- **Output Filtering and Sanitization**: Use output validation mechanisms to scrub any sensitive information from the generated summaries.  \n- **Data Leakage Prevention**: Ensure that no personally identifiable information (PII) is included in the training datasets and utilize techniques like differential privacy.  \n- **Model Access Controls**: Restrict access to the model to authorized personnel only, implementing role-based access controls.  \n- **Rate Limiting and Abuse Prevention**: Introduce rate limiting to prevent abuse of the data extraction features, including throttling requests.  \n- **Monitoring for Adversarial Inputs**: Implement monitoring to detect unusual patterns of input that may indicate attempts at adversarial attacks.  \n\n#### Health History and Visualization  \n- **Model Versioning and Rollback Capabilities**: Maintain version control for ML models, allowing rollback to previous versions if vulnerabilities are discovered.  \n- **Supply Chain Security for Models**: Assess and verify third-party libraries and tools used in model training and deployment for vulnerabilities.  \n- **Bias and Fairness Considerations**: Regularly audit models for bias and ensure fairness in the analysis by utilizing fairness metrics and retraining as necessary.  \n\n### 7.4. Integration with Existing Security Controls  \nAI controls integrate with standard security practices by augmenting user authentication mechanisms (e.g., multi-factor authentication), data encryption protocols, and privacy policies. Additionally, audit logging and monitoring will ensure that all AI interactions are recorded and can be reviewed for compliance and security purposes. The established framework for data retention and deletion will work in conjunction with AI components to ensure sensitive information is managed appropriately.\n\n### 7.5.
