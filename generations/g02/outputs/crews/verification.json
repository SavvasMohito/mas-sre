  "raw": "### 11.1. Testing Approach  \nIntegrate security testing throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC) with an emphasis on continuous security practices. Balance automated scanning with manual evaluations to prioritize high-risk areas based on business impact, adhering to shift-left security principles by incorporating security testing earlier and continuously. This approach will ensure that security is embedded into every phase of development, enabling faster identification and remediation of vulnerabilities while complying with relevant regulatory frameworks.\n\n### 11.2. Testing Methods  \n| Method | Frequency | Tools |\n|--------|-----------|-------|\n| STATIC APPLICATION SECURITY TESTING (SAST) | Every commit/build | SonarQube, Semgrep, Checkmarx, CodeQL |\n| DYNAMIC APPLICATION SECURITY TESTING (DAST) | Nightly/weekly | OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, Acunetix |\n| DEPENDENCY SCANNING | Every build | Snyk, Dependabot, OWASP Dependency-Check |\n| SECRETS SCANNING | Every commit | TruffleHog, GitLeaks, GitHub Secret Scanning |\n| CONTAINER/INFRASTRUCTURE SCANNING | Every deployment | Trivy, Clair, Prowler, ScoutSuite |\n| PENETRATION TESTING | Quarterly or before major releases | Custom scripts, Metasploit, Burp Suite Pro |\n| SECURITY CODE REVIEW | For critical features | GitHub/GitLab code review, security checklists |\n| COMPLIANCE SCANNING | Continuous | AWS Config, Azure Policy, Cloud Custodian |\n\n### 11.3. Compliance Verification  \nMulti-standard compliance (OWASP ASVS, NIST SP 800-53, ISO 27001) will be verified through automated tools and manual checks against regulatory requirements such as GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS. Audit preparation will involve ensuring documentation and evidence collection for external audits, including maintaining detailed logs and consent records. Recommendations will include engaging third-party auditors to conduct comprehensive evaluations of compliance posture and address any identified gaps.\n\n### 11.4. Continuous Monitoring  \nImplement Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) for real-time monitoring, supported by Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) to identify and mitigate threats. All logs will be aggregated and analyzed for anomalies, with integration into incident response processes to ensure prompt action against security events. Continuous monitoring will also include regular assessments of vendor compliance and performance to manage third-party risks effectively.\n\n### 11.5. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)  \n- Mean time to detect (MTTD) security issues  \n- Mean time to remediate (MTTR) vulnerabilities  \n- Percentage of critical vulnerabilities patched within SLA  \n- Security test coverage percentage  \n- False positive rate in automated scanning  \n- Compliance audit pass rate  \n\n### 11.6. Mapping Testing Methods to Security Controls  \n| Testing Method | Security Controls Verified |\n|----------------|---------------------------|\n| STATIC APPLICATION SECURITY TESTING (SAST) | Input validation, injection flaws, hardcoded secrets |\n| DYNAMIC APPLICATION SECURITY TESTING (DAST) | Authentication, authorization, XSS, CSRF, SQL injection |\n| DEPENDENCY SCANNING | Supply chain security |\n| SECRETS SCANNING | Cryptographic protection |\n| CONTAINER/INFRASTRUCTURE SCANNING | Configuration management |\n| PENETRATION TESTING | All high-risk controls |\n| SECURITY CODE REVIEW | Authentication, authorization, crypto implementations |\n| COMPLIANCE SCANNING | All compliance-related controls |",
