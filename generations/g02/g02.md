Blood Test Analysis Application Requirements

We need to build a web application that allows users to upload and analyze their blood test results using AI-powered data extraction and visualization.

Key Features:

1. User Management
   - User registration and login
   - User profiles with personal details (age, gender, optional health metrics)
   - Password recovery and account management
   - User consent and privacy preferences management

2. Blood Test Uploads
   - Upload images or PDF files of blood test results
   - Support uploads from device storage
   - Direct image capture using mobile cameras
   - Include metadata such as test date and laboratory name
   - File format and quality validation
   - Upload progress and completion status

3. AI Data Extraction and Analysis
   - OCR and AI-based extraction from uploaded reports
   - Extract test names, values, units, and reference ranges
   - Identify abnormal values automatically
   - Generate easy-to-understand summaries
   - Provide explanations and contextual insights for findings

4. Health History and Visualization
   - Maintain historical record of blood test data
   - View results over time using charts and visual summaries
   - Filter data by test type or date range
   - Trend indicators showing improvement or deterioration in key health markers
   - Export data in PDF or CSV format

5. Notifications and Alerts
   - Notify users when AI analysis is complete
   - Alert users when test results fall outside normal range
   - Configurable notification preferences
   - Email and in-app notifications

The application will handle sensitive medical data and must support users managing their health information over time.
