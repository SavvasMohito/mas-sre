Collaborative Whiteboarding Application Requirements

We need to build an online collaborative whiteboarding platform for distributed teams to brainstorm, design, and plan projects visually in real time.

Key Features:

1. User Management
   - User registration and authentication (email, SSO, and OAuth with Google/Microsoft)
   - Team and workspace creation with granular access control (Owner, Admin, Member, Guest)
   - User profiles with role-based permissions and organization-level settings
   - Invitation system for adding collaborators to boards and teams

2. Board Management
   - Create, edit, duplicate, and delete boards
   - Organize boards within projects and teams
   - Manage sharing options (private, team-only, public link)
   - Version history and undo/redo capabilities
   - Board templates for different use cases (brainstorming, retrospectives, UX flows)

3. Real-Time Collaboration
   - Multiple users editing a board simultaneously
   - Live cursors showing collaborator presence
   - In-board chat and commenting functionality
   - @mentions and threaded discussions
   - Audio/video conferencing integration during collaboration sessions

4. Whiteboard Tools
   - Infinite canvas with pan and zoom support
   - Drawing tools: shapes, lines, connectors, sticky notes, text boxes
   - Grouping and alignment features for objects
   - Smart connectors for flow diagrams
   - Embedding external content (images, documents, videos, links)
   - Interactive widgets such as voting and timers

5. Integrations
   - Integration with productivity tools (Jira, Asana, Trello)
   - Cloud storage integrations (Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive)
   - Communication tools integration (Slack, Microsoft Teams)
   - API for custom integrations and automation

6. File Management
   - Upload and manage assets within boards
   - Support for common image and document formats (PNG, PDF, DOCX, etc.)
   - Export boards as images or PDFs
   - Version control for uploaded files and embedded objects

7. Access Control
   - Board access settings (view, comment, edit, ownership transfer)
   - Audit logs for user activity and changes

8. Notifications
   - In-app and email notifications for mentions, comments, and board changes
   - Optional integrations for notification channels (Slack, Teams)
   - Configurable notification preferences per user

9. Performance and Scalability
   - Low-latency real-time updates for large boards with many collaborators
   - Efficient synchronization and conflict resolution
   - Horizontal scaling to support enterprise-level organizations

10. Reporting and Analytics
    - Usage analytics per team or organization (active boards, users, sessions)
    - Export of activity logs and board metrics
    - Admin dashboards for license management

The application will be accessible via modern web browsers and native desktop/mobile clients. It will store user accounts, workspace data, board content, activity logs, and integration metadata in secure cloud infrastructure.
