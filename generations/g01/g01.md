   - Channel workspace creation and management

2. Content Management
  - Create, edit, and delete blog posts
  - Assign posts to agents or users
  - Schedule and tag posts for multichannel publication
  - Add comments and attachments to posts
  - Track post status (Draft, In Review, Published)

3. Collaboration
  - Real-time post updates and status changes
  - Threaded comments on posts
  - @mention notifications for contributors and agents
  - Activity feed of recent system actions

4. Agent Integration
  - Prolog-driven continuous agent publishing and moderation
  - Automated topic suggestion and content enrichment
  - Rule-based workflow coordination between agents and users

5. Channel Management
