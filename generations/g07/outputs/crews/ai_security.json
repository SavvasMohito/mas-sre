AI/ML Security Controls  \n\n#### Translation Engine  \n- **Prompt Injection Prevention**: Implement input sanitization and validation to prevent malicious prompts from altering the intended output.  \n- **Input Validation for AI Inputs**: Ensure strict validation for all inputs, particularly focusing on language tags and document formats to prevent malformed data submissions.  \n- **Output Filtering and Sanitization**: Apply content filtering mechanisms to ensure that no unintended commentary or reasoning is present in the output.  \n- **Data Leakage Prevention**: Implement measures to prevent the inclusion of personally identifiable information (PII) in training data, and ensure proper handling of sensitive documents during translation.  \n- **Model Access Controls**: Enforce strict access controls to the translation engine, ensuring that only authorized personnel can interact with the model.  \n- **Rate Limiting and Abuse Prevention**: Deploy rate limiting on API endpoints to mitigate the risk of abuse and ensure fair usage across clients.  \n- **Monitoring for Adversarial Inputs**: Implement logging and monitoring to detect unusual input patterns that may signify adversarial attacks.  \n- **Model Versioning and Rollback Capabilities**: Maintain version control for models to facilitate easy rollback in the event of detected vulnerabilities or issues.  \n- **Supply Chain Security for Models**: Conduct security assessments on third-party models and libraries used, ensuring they comply with security standards.  \n\n#### Document Processing Module  \n- **Adversarial Input Monitoring**: Monitor inputs for adversarial patterns that could lead to model inversion attacks or other vulnerabilities.  \n- **Bias and Fairness Considerations**: Regularly evaluate the model for biases and fairness issues, and implement corrective measures as necessary.  \n- **Secure Key Management**: Ensure that cryptographic keys used in the document processing module are securely managed and rotated regularly.  \n\n### 7.4. Integration with Existing Security Controls  \nAI/ML security controls must be integrated with existing security practices such as strong authentication, access control, encryption, and auditing. This includes leveraging multi-factor authentication (MFA) for API access, ensuring end-to-end encryption for data at rest and in transit, and implementing comprehensive logging that includes AI-specific actions and anomalies. These measures will enhance the overall security posture and ensure that AI/ML components are protected against unique threats.\n\n### 7.5.
