Define allowed / disallowed fields, hashing vs. anonymization rules, sampling policies for metadata, and retention and access controls for telemetry. Add periodic telemetry audits to prove no content leakage.\\n9) DSAR and deletion across tiers & backups: define end-to-end deletion requirements including persistence in temporary storage, caches, model input caches, logs, and backups. State RTO/RPO expectations for deletion, and require proof of deletion (or documented limitations and compensating controls) for immutable backups. Add automated DSAR API-level testing.\\n10) Incident response specifics for ML incidents: extend IR playbooks with ML-specific incidents: model-exfiltration, prompt-injection leading to data exfil, poisoning, and model-behavior regressions.
