  "raw": "### 11.1. Testing Approach  \nIntegrate security testing throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC) with an emphasis on continuous security practices. Balance automated scanning with manual evaluations to prioritize high-risk areas based on business impact, adhering to shift-left security principles by incorporating security testing earlier and continuously. This approach ensures vulnerabilities are identified and remediated promptly, reducing potential risks and enhancing overall security posture.\n\n### 11.2. Testing Methods  \n| Method                                          | Frequency                  | Tools                                            |  \n|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|  \n| STATIC APPLICATION SECURITY TESTING (SAST)     | Every commit/build         | SonarQube, Semgrep, Checkmarx, CodeQL           |  \n| DYNAMIC APPLICATION SECURITY TESTING (DAST)    | Nightly/weekly            | OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, Acunetix                 |  \n| DEPENDENCY SCANNING                            | Every build               | Snyk, Dependabot, OWASP Dependency-Check        |  \n| SECRETS SCANNING                               | Every commit              | TruffleHog, GitLeaks, GitHub Secret Scanning    |  \n| CONTAINER/INFRASTRUCTURE SCANNING             | Every deployment          | Trivy, Clair, Prowler, ScoutSuite                |  \n| PENETRATION TESTING                            | Quarterly or before major releases | Custom scripts, Metasploit, Burp Suite Pro  |  \n| SECURITY CODE REVIEW                           | For critical features     | GitHub/GitLab code review, security checklists   |  \n| COMPLIANCE SCANNING                            | Continuous                | AWS Config, Azure Policy, Cloud Custodian        |  \n\n### 11.3. Compliance Verification  \nMulti-standard compliance (OWASP ASVS, NIST SP 800-53, ISO 27001) will be verified through automated tools and manual checks against regulatory requirements such as GDPR, CCPA, and PCI-DSS. Audit preparation will involve ensuring documentation and evidence collection for external audits, including logs, test results, and compliance reports. Recommendations will include engaging third-party auditors for comprehensive evaluations to confirm adherence to security and compliance standards.\n\n### 11.4. Continuous Monitoring  \nImplement Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) for real-time monitoring, supported by Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) to identify and mitigate threats. All logs will be aggregated and analyzed for anomalies, with integration into incident response processes to ensure prompt action against security events. This continuous monitoring strategy will enable proactive identification of potential breaches and enhance the overall security posture.\n\n### 11.5. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)  \n- Mean time to detect (MTTD) security issues  \n- Mean time to remediate (MTTR) vulnerabilities  \n- Percentage of critical vulnerabilities patched within SLA  \n- Security test coverage percentage  \n- False positive rate in automated scanning  \n- Compliance audit pass rate  \n\n### 11.6. Mapping of Testing Methods to Security Controls  \n- **SAST**: Validates input validation, injection flaws, hardcoded secrets (OWASP ASVS, NIST SP 800-53, ISO 27001)  \n- **DAST**: Tests for authentication, authorization, XSS, CSRF, and SQL injection (OWASP ASVS, NIST SP 800-53)  \n- **Dependency Scanning**: Assesses supply chain security (NIST SP 800-53)  \n- **Secrets Scanning**: Ensures cryptographic protection is in place (OWASP ASVS)  \n- **Container Scanning**: Validates configuration management (NIST SP 800-53, ISO 27001)  \n- **Penetration Testing**: Covers all high-risk controls (OWASP ASVS, NIST SP 800-53)  \n- **Security Code Review**: Focuses on authentication, authorization, crypto implementations (OWASP ASVS)  \n- **Compliance Scanning**: Verifies compliance-related controls (ISO 27001, GDPR, and other regulations)  \n\nThis comprehensive verification and testing strategy ensures that the translation engine meets security requirements while adhering to necessary compliance standards, ultimately enhancing its security posture and reliability.",
