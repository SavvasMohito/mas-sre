Confidential Translation Engine Requirements

We need to build a translation service that provides confidential document translation with strict privacy guarantees for sensitive content.

Key Features:

1. Translation Services
   - Synchronous translation for short texts (real-time, less than 1 second)
   - Support for UI fields, short messages, and office correspondence
   - Direct response without task creation
   - Asynchronous translation for large documents
   - Support for long-running translations (multi-page PDFs, XML, DOCX)
   - Scalable task execution and isolation per-request

2. Language Support
   - Full support for European languages used in patent workflows (EN/DE/FR/ES/IT/NL/PT/PL etc.)
   - Extensible to Asian languages (ZH/JA/KO)
   - Strict input validation for language tags (BCP-47)

3. Document Processing
   - Translation must preserve technical terminology, claim structure, legal phrasing, and formatting
   - Guaranteed non-addition of commentary or reasoning content in output
   - Support for patent-domain fidelity

4. API & Integration
   - REST API, OpenAPI 3.1 compliant
   - Separation between synchronous text endpoints and asynchronous processing endpoints
   - Status and result endpoints for task tracking
   - ST.90 compliant workflow for asynchronous processing

5. Performance
   - Real-time translation for short strings (≤1 second)
   - Efficient batching and parallelization under high load
   - Stable deterministic performance

6. Monitoring & Observability
   - Track throughput, latency, error rates, GPU utilization
   - Non-intrusive monitoring without content inspection

The platform will process sensitive documents requiring strict confidentiality guarantees. It will handle translation requests, task management, and provide API access for integration with other systems.
