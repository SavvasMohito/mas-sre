Specify accepted token formats/algorithms (e.g., JWT RS256) and secure cookie attributes (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite).\\n2) Identity provisioning and lifecycle: require SCIM or automated provisioning/deprovisioning for SSO integrations, periodic account access reviews, emergency break-glass access controls with logged approvals, and vetting proof artifacts retention rules.\\n3) Secrets & key management: specify use of managed KMS/HSM for keys, key rotation schedule (e.g., 90 days for symmetric; annual for master keys), separation of encryption keys per tenant for data residency isolation, and rules for credential storage (no secrets in code or repo).\\n4) API & integration security: add explicit API security controls \u2014 API gateway, rate-limiting, mutual TLS or signed webhooks, OAuth scope-minimization, token revocation endpoint tests, and webhook signature verification. Define least-privilege scopes per integration (Teams/Outlook, DocuSign, CAT tools).\\n5) Data residency, classification and retention details: map data classes to retention periods and storage locations (e.g., audit logs WORM for X years), specify per-country residency requirements and enforcement (region-specific KMS, geo-fencing), and document retention/deletion workflows (pseudonymization before deletion when required).\\n6) Logging & monitoring operationalization: specify SIEM ingestion format, log retention periods per regulation (e.g., 7 years for government finance), log access controls, integrity checks (e.g., HMAC or signed log entries), alerting thresholds, and responsibilities for log review cadence.\\n7) Secure file previewing and rendering: require sandboxed preview rendering (no direct execution of uploaded content), HTML sanitization for document previews, content-disposition handling, and limits for file types/sizes.
