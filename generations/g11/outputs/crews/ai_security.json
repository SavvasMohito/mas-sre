AI/ML Components Detected  \nThis section identifies all AI/ML components within the system that require specialized security controls.  \n1. **Automated Assignment Engine**: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to match interpreters and translators with tasks based on language pairs, availability, and certifications.  \n2. **Task Lifecycle Management**: Employs AI to track task progress and make recommendations for task assignments.  \n3. **Real-Time Updates System**: May involve AI-driven notification systems to inform users of changes in task status or new assignments.  \n\n### 7.2. AI/ML Threat Model  \n\n| Component                       | Identified Threats                               |\n|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| Automated Assignment Engine      | - Model poisoning<br>- Data leakage through training data<br>- Adversarial inputs<br>- Prompt injection |\n| Task Lifecycle Management        | - Input validation vulnerabilities<br>- Output filtering issues<br>- Adversarial inputs |\n| Real-Time Updates System         | - Rate limiting and abuse potential<br>- Data leakage through notifications |\n\n### 7.3. AI/ML Security Controls  \n\n#### Automated Assignment Engine  \n**Prompt Injection Prevention**: Implement strict input validation to prevent malicious prompts from altering task assignments.  \n**Data Leakage Prevention**: Ensure that no personally identifiable information (PII) is included in the training data and prompt inputs.  \n**Model Access Controls**: Limit access to the model to authorized personnel only.  \n**Monitoring for Adversarial Inputs**: Deploy monitoring systems to detect unusual patterns in input data indicative of adversarial attacks.  \n\n#### Task Lifecycle Management  \n**Input Validation for AI Inputs**: Validate inputs rigorously to mitigate injection attacks and ensure expected formats.  \n**Output Filtering and Sanitization**: Filter outputs to remove any sensitive information that could be exploited.  \n**Model Versioning and Rollback Capabilities**: Maintain version control for models to allow rollback in case of identified vulnerabilities or failures.  \n\n#### Real-Time Updates System  \n**Rate Limiting and Abuse Prevention**: Implement rate limiting for notifications to prevent abuse and reduce the risk of denial-of-service attacks.  \n**Monitoring for Adversarial Inputs**: Monitor system interactions for signs of adversarial manipulation in real-time notifications.  \n\n### 7.4. Integration with Existing Security Controls  \nThe AI/ML security controls integrate with standard security practices by enhancing existing frameworks like access control, input validation, and incident response. AI-specific controls such as monitoring for adversarial inputs complement traditional cybersecurity measures, ensuring a holistic security posture that protects both AI components and the overall application.\n\n### 7.5.
