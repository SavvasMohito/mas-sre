  "raw": "### 10.1. Prioritization Framework\n\nPrioritization is critical for effective security implementation because it ensures that the most critical vulnerabilities and compliance requirements are addressed first, minimizing potential risks and protecting sensitive data. By organizing security controls into a phased implementation plan, organizations can allocate resources efficiently, address dependencies, and achieve compliance in a timely manner. The following criteria were used to prioritize the implementation of security controls:\n\n**Prioritization Criteria:**\n\n- **Risk Level**: Controls addressing critical and high-risk threats (identified through threat modeling) are prioritized first   \n- **Compliance Deadlines**: Regulatory requirements and compliance deadlines influence immediate priority   \n- **Technical Complexity**: Controls requiring foundational infrastructure are implemented early to enable subsequent controls   \n- **Dependencies**: Controls that other security measures depend upon are prioritized accordingly   \n- **Resource Availability**: Implementation considers the availability of skilled personnel, tools, and budget   \n- **Business Impact**: Controls protecting business-critical functions and data receive higher priority   \n\nThese criteria work together to create a logical implementation sequence that balances security needs with practical constraints, ensuring that critical vulnerabilities are addressed promptly while maintaining operational efficiency.\n\n### 10.2. Phased Implementation Plan\n\n#### Phase: IMMEDIATE\n\n**Timeline:** 0-1 months\n\n**Rationale:** Address critical vulnerabilities and compliance blockers to mitigate high-risk threats and ensure regulatory adherence.\n\n**Controls to Implement:**\n\n- Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all users, especially administrative and agency accounts   \n- Implement basic encryption for sensitive data in transit and at rest   \n- Secure SSO configurations with strict audience, issuer, and certificate validation   \n- Conduct an initial Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) for compliance with GDPR   \n\n**Dependencies:**\n\n- None\n\n#### Phase: SHORT-TERM\n\n**Timeline:** 1-3 months\n\n**Rationale:** Enhance access control and security monitoring capabilities to build on immediate controls and improve overall security posture.\n\n**Controls to Implement:**\n\n- Enhance user authentication through comprehensive multi-factor authentication   \n- Deploy role-based access controls across the admin dashboard   \n- Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring for all administrative actions   \n- Strengthen API security with input validation and HTTPS protocols   \n- Begin encryption for all sensitive data at rest   \n\n**Dependencies:**\n\n- Completion of TLS Implementation   \n- Completion of multi-factor authentication   \n\n#### Phase: MEDIUM-TERM\n\n**Timeline:** 3-6 months\n\n**Rationale:** Focus on advanced threat detection and testing to identify and mitigate emerging risks, while ensuring third-party integrations are secure.\n\n**Controls to Implement:**\n\n- Deploy advanced threat detection systems   \n- Automate security testing (SAST/DAST) and vulnerability scanning   \n- Conduct third-party security audits for integrations (e.g., DocuSign, calendar services)   \n- Enhance data protection measures, including encryption key management and DLP   \n\n**Dependencies:**\n\n- Completion of comprehensive logging and monitoring   \n- Completion of API security enhancements   \n\n#### Phase: LONG-TERM\n\n**Timeline:** 6-12 months\n\n**Rationale:** Implement strategic security initiatives and continuous improvement practices to mature the security program.\n\n**Controls to Implement:**\n\n- Develop and implement a security maturity model for continuous improvement   \n- Deploy advanced AI/ML security controls for anomaly detection   \n- Conduct comprehensive penetration testing for ongoing security validation   \n- Launch security awareness and training programs for staff   \n\n**Dependencies:**\n\n- Completion of threat detection systems   \n- Completion of security testing automation   \n\n#### Phase: ONGOING\n\n**Timeline:** Continuous\n\n**Rationale:** Maintain continuous security operations to ensure ongoing protection and compliance.\n\n**Controls to Implement:**\n\n- Continuous security monitoring and incident response readiness   \n- Regular patch management and vulnerability remediation   \n- Conduct periodic compliance audits and risk assessments   \n- Maintain up-to-date security policies and procedures   \n\n**Dependencies:**\n\n- None\n\n### 10.3.
