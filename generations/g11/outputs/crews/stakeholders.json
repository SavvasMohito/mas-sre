Trust Model\n\nTrust boundaries are established at the user interface, backend server, and database levels. Security mechanisms enforcing boundaries include user authentication (email/password and SSO with MFA), role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure users can only access data and functionalities pertinent to their roles, and network segmentation to mitigate risks of unauthorized access. Admins have comprehensive access to manage system configurations and user privileges. Coordinators can manage bookings and tasks, while interpreters, translators, and reviewers have restricted access to only those tasks they are assigned to, ensuring that they cannot view or modify unrelated data. Agency users are limited to their workspace, ensuring tenant isolation. Service accounts have specific, limited permissions to perform automated tasks, and their activities are logged for auditing. The principle of least privilege is implemented by granting users the minimum access necessary to perform their responsibilities, thereby reducing the risk of data exposure and privilege escalation.",
