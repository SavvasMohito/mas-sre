Interpreter & Translator Service Management Application Requirements

We need to build a web application for managing interpreter and translator bookings, document translation workflows, and collaboration between government agencies and service providers.

Key Features:

1. User Management
   - User registration and login using email or SSO
   - Multiple roles: Admin, Coordinator, Interpreter, Translator, Reviewer, Agency User
   - User profiles with language pairs, certifications, and availability
   - Separate workspaces for agencies to manage their own requests

2. Task Management
   - Create, edit, and delete interpreting bookings
   - Create translation jobs with document uploads
   - Assign interpreters/translators based on availability and language requirements
   - Track task progress through defined stages
   - Support attachments, comments, and activity logs for each task

3. Collaboration
   - Comment on tasks and mention other users using @mentions
   - Real-time updates on task changes
   - Activity feed showing recent team actions

4. File Management
   - Upload, preview, and download task-related files
   - Maintain file version history
   - File access restricted based on user roles

5. Notifications
   - Email notifications for new assignments and status updates
   - In-app notifications for mentions and approvals
   - Optional SMS alerts for urgent bookings
   - Daily summary email summarizing assigned tasks and activity

6. Reporting
   - Dashboards showing task statistics and productivity
   - Export reports as CSV or PDF
   - Agencies can access spending and performance reports

7. Integration
   - Integration with Outlook/Teams calendars for booking synchronization
   - Integration with email services for transactional notifications
   - Integration with DocuSign for electronic signatures
   - Optional integration with translation tools (CAT software)

8. System Requirements

The application will handle sensitive government data, manage interpreter and translator assignments, process translation workflows, and maintain audit logs. It will integrate with third-party services like email, calendar, and video conferencing tools.
