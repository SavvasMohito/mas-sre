Multi-Layer Infrastructure & Cloud Project Management Platform Requirements

We need to build a web application for managing multi-layer infrastructure and cloud projects with structured workflows and collaboration features.

Key Features:

1. User Management
   - Allow infrastructure administrators to access system management features (role: Infra Admin)
   - Provide application and cloud resource access controls with roles: admin, user, and reader
   - Manage, assign, and audit virtual machine access per user, including mapping users to specific VMs and permission levels

2. Data Management
   - Specify and manage allowed ingress and egress ports per virtual machine; store firewall rules and port assignments per VM
   - Record and control ingress (source) and egress (destination) IP endpoints for every VM, with reporting and auditing features

3. Task Management
   - Structure each project as layered stages: hardware provisioning, network setup, network verification, container environment, storage system, cloud setup, authentication & authorization
   - Assign users to develop and deliver individual layers, ensuring clear accountability and task ownership
   - Enforce layer sequencing: prevent layer creation until the prerequisite previous layer is completed and approved
   - Define deadlines for each layer; escalate layer status if not completed by its due date to management dashboard and notifications

4. Collaboration
   - Enable all users to track their assigned layers and due dates via dashboard and notifications
   - Require each user to submit a handover design document upon completing their layer to facilitate smooth transitions
   - Mandate next-layer user approval or rejection of handover, with feedback loop and traceable logs for decisions
   - Keep users available after their layers are finished to address blocker escalations or dependencies identified in later stages

5. File Management
   - For air-gapped projects, provision an isolated server with internet access as a prerequisite for tool/image downloads
   - Automate local repository mirroring and store essential images/tools on dedicated bare-metal servers before disconnecting from the internet
   - After disconnecting, ensure all project servers retain access to the bare-metal repository for required images and configuration files

6. Notifications
   - Send real-time email or internal chat alerts to the project manager whenever a layer's process is completed
   - Notify all project members upon completion of each project layer, including status and relevant reports
   - Alert the user due to start the next layer one week before the scheduled date via preferred communication channels
   - Integrate with project monitoring system to raise alerts for critical events or blockers before project begins
   - Provide system administrators with log summary report upon detection of failures or critical errors

7. Reporting
   - Enable project managers to assign roles and maintain a record of user assignments and progress reports
   - Display project progress by layer, status, and deadlines in a manager-facing dashboard
   - Maintain a conflict list tracking all bugs and blockers; mark their status as Blocked, Untriaged, In Progress, or Fixed
   - Require completion of both handover documentation and a final report for each layer, due no later than one week after the layer's deadline
   - Generate and send progress summaries from the project manager to customers via formal email, ensuring traceability and transparency

8. Platform Access & Integrations
   - Provide secure SSH access to infrastructure resources and web-based access for application/cloud layer workflows
   - Require internet access for initial image pulls and integration with Infrastructure-as-Code tools (e.g., Terraform); if restricted, mandate an additional server to host required images locally

This requirements list thoroughly covers the requested management, collaboration, and technical workflows for a layered, multi-user infrastructure application, and should serve well for evaluating the security requirements engineering tool.
