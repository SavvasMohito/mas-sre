Users interact via web UI or automated APIs; the backend enforces sequencing, handles per-VM policies and audit logging, triggers notifications and escalations, mirrors artifacts for disconnected environments, and integrates with external systems (SSO/MFA, email/chat, monitoring, IaC registries).",

When artifacts or images are required, the Artifact Repo supplies images to VMs or mirrors external registries during staging for air-gapped projects. The Workflow Engine enforces sequencing and triggers notifications and escalations via the Notification service which integrates with Email/Chat. Monitoring systems send alerts to the platform which then escalate to PMs and SIEM. SSH Gateway/ bastion manages controlled access into VMs; all access and session metadata are written to logs. Key transformation points: user actions -> API calls, workflow state transitions -> DB updates and audit writes, artifact staging -> repository mirroring and integrity verification, and alert events -> notification dispatch and escalation.",
