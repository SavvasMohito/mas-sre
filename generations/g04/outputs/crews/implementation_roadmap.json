Prioritization Framework\n\nPrioritization is critical for effective security implementation because it ensures that resources are allocated to the most pressing vulnerabilities and compliance requirements first, reducing the risk of breaches and penalties. This approach balances the need for security with practical business operations, ensuring that critical threats and compliance obligations are addressed promptly.\n\n**Prioritization Criteria:**\n\n- **Risk Level**: Controls addressing critical and high-risk threats (identified through threat modeling) are prioritized first\n\n- **Compliance Deadlines**: Regulatory requirements and compliance deadlines influence immediate priority\n\n- **Technical Complexity**: Controls requiring foundational infrastructure are implemented early to enable subsequent controls\n\n- **Dependencies**: Controls that other security measures depend upon are prioritized accordingly\n\n- **Resource Availability**: Implementation considers the availability of skilled personnel, tools, and budget\n\n- **Business Impact**: Controls protecting business-critical functions and data receive higher priority\n\nThese criteria work together to create a logical implementation sequence that balances security needs with practical constraints. By addressing the highest risks and compliance requirements first, while considering technical dependencies and resource availability, the plan ensures a comprehensive and efficient approach to enhancing security posture.\n\n### 10.2. Phased Implementation Plan\n\n#### Phase: IMMEDIATE\n**Timeline:** 0-1 months\n\n**Rationale:** This phase focuses on addressing critical vulnerabilities and compliance blockers which pose the highest risk if not mitigated immediately.
